<p>Dear corresponding author of a recent paper in $journal, 

<p>If you have already participated in our research study on data archiving:  thank you!  I apologize for this final reminder email.

<p>If you haven't yet completed the questionnaire, would you consider doing so <b>in the next week</b>?  The higher the response rate from <b>all contacted corresponding authors</b>, the <b>more accurate and less biased</b> the research findings will be.  Community norms around data sharing are still developing:  I hope to hear from people with a wide range of backgrounds, opinions, and experiences.  The results will help inform future data archiving policies.

<p><b>The online questionnaire will take about 8-12 minutes.</b>  More information about the research study is included below and on the first page of the questionnaire.  Those who complete the questionnaire may enter a drawing for a 20 dollar Amazon.com gift certificate.

<p>There will be no more reminder emails.  If you would like to learn about our eventual findings, you can subscribe to news at the research study website (see below).

<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions, anytime.  I know you receive many invitations for online questionnaires: thank you for your participation in this one.

<p>Sincerely,

<h1>The impact of public data archiving policies on attitudes, experiences, and practices of authors</h1>

<h2>What is this survey about?</h2>
Policies that request and require investigators to share research data are becoming more common. This research explores the impact of such policies on the experiences, attitudes, and practices of active scientists. The results will help inform future data archiving policies.

<h2>Why should I participate?</h2>
You have been selected to receive this survey invitation as the corresponding author of a recently published paper in a select group of journals. By participating in this survey, you will help improve <b>the accuracy and generalizability</b> of the research findings.

<p>Please complete this survey regardless of your background or opinions!  Community norms around public data archiving are still developing.  It is important to hear from everyone who receives this invitation:

<ul>
<li>students and new scientists as well as those with many years of experience
<li>scientists who have shared data before and those who haven't
<li>people with strong opinions about these issues, and also those who haven't thought much about them before.
</ul>

<h2>The questionnaire will take about 8-12 minutes to complete.</h2>
Questions will be asked about your thoughts and experiences with public data archiving.

<h2>What is the benefit to me?</h2>
The direct benefit is a warm glow from knowing that you have contributed to the understanding of scientific data sharing and reuse, and that your opinion is being counted and will influence future policy. In addition, as a small token of appreciation for completing the survey, I invite you to enter a one-time drawing for a 20 dollar Amazon.com gift certificate.  The winner of the drawing will be randomly chosen from all entries collected in this round of the questionnaire. 

<h2>Will my responses be anonymous?</h2>
Yes.  You will be invited to provide an optional email address for the sole (and temporary) purpose of the prize drawing: your email address will not be associated with your survey responses in any way.

<p>I plan on maximizing the usefulness of this research by making the anonymous questionnaire responses openly available in a data repository, after aggregating or obfuscating any responses that could otherwise facilitate identification.

<p>This research study has been approved by the IRB at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 
	
<h2>Is this study endorsed by my journal?</h2>
This independent research study is neither affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any publisher or journal.  
	
<h2>More information?</h2>
More details on this study are available at <a href="http://studyonimpactofjournaldatapolicies.wordpress.com/">the research study website</a>.

Thanks very much for taking the time to record your opinions and experiences. Please contact me with any questions or suggestions, anytime.
