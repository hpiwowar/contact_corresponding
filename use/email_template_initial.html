<p>Dear corresponding author of a recent paper in $journal, 

<p>Policies for <b>sharing research datasets</b> are currently receiving much attention from funders, journals, and institutions.  I am conducting a research study of author opinions, experiences, and practices related to sharing research datasets.  

<p><b><em>Your</em> participation, as a selected corresponding author</b>, is extremely valuable.  A high response rate from those who receive this invitation &mdash; across all backgrounds, opinions, and experiences &mdash; will help maximize <b>the accuracy and generalizability of the research findings.</b> 

<p>The results of this research study will help inform future data sharing policies.

<p><b>The online questionnaire will take about 8-12 minutes.</b>  More information about the research study is included below and on the first page of the questionnaire.  Those who complete the questionnaire may choose to enter a drawing for a 20 dollar Amazon.com gift certificate.

<p>Please click <a href="$url"> here to go to the questionnaire.</a>

<p>If you would like to opt-out of a reminder email to be sent in about a week, <a href="mailto:impactofjournaldatapolicies+unsubscribe@gmail.com">send a blank unsubscribe email</a>.

<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions, anytime.  Thanks very much for your participation!

<p>Sincerely,

<h1>The impact of public data archiving policies on attitudes, experiences, and practices of authors</h1>

<h2>What is this survey about?</h2>
Policies that request and require investigators to share research data are becoming more common. This research explores the impact of such policies on the experiences, attitudes, and practices of active scientists. The results will help inform future data archiving policies.

<h2>Why should I participate?</h2>
You have been selected to receive this survey invitation as the corresponding author of a recently published paper in a select group of journals. By participating in this survey, you will help improve <b>the accuracy and generalizability</b> of the research findings.

<p>Please complete this survey regardless of your background or opinions!  Community norms around public data archiving are still developing.  It is important to hear from everyone who receives this invitation:

<ul>
<li>students and new scientists as well as those with many years of experience
<li>scientists who have shared data before and those who haven't
<li>people with strong opinions about these issues, and also those who haven't thought much about them before.
</ul>

<h2>The questionnaire will take about 8-12 minutes to complete.</h2>
Questions will be asked about your thoughts and experiences with public data archiving.

<h2>What is the benefit to me?</h2>
The direct benefit is a warm glow from knowing that you have contributed to the understanding of scientific data sharing and reuse, and that your opinion is being counted and will influence future policy. In addition, as a small token of appreciation for completing the survey, I invite you to enter a one-time drawing for a 20 dollar Amazon.com gift certificate.  The winner of the drawing will be randomly chosen from all entries collected in this round of the questionnaire. 

<h2>Will my responses be anonymous?</h2>
Yes.  You will be invited to provide an optional email address for the sole (and temporary) purpose of the prize drawing: your email address will not be associated with your survey responses in any way.

<p>I plan on maximizing the usefulness of this research by making the anonymous questionnaire responses openly available in a data repository, after aggregating or obfuscating any responses that could otherwise facilitate identification.
	
<p>This research study has been approved by the IRB at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 

<h2>Is this study endorsed by my journal?</h2>
This independent research study is neither affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any publisher or journal.  
	
<h2>More information?</h2>
More details on this study are available at <a href="http://studyonimpactofjournaldatapolicies.wordpress.com/">the research study website</a>.

<p>Thanks very much for taking the time to record your opinions and experiences. Please contact me with any questions or suggestions, anytime.

<p>Sincerely,
