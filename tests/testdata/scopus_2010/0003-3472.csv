Although there has been a bias towards studying negative emotions, research into positive emotions is necessary for an overall welfare assessment. The aim of the current study was to find behavioural expressions specific for anticipation of different events in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus. To this aim, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm by which we induced anticipation of a positive, neutral and negative event. We investigated whether birds were able to discriminate between sound cues signalling these events with different valences and, if so, whether anticipation of different events is reflected in different behavioural responses. The birds showed a response of increased attention to all sound cues. In anticipation of the negative event, the birds showed more head movements and locomotion than in anticipation of both the neutral and positive event, possibly reflecting the aversive nature of the negative event. In anticipation of the positive event, the birds showed more comfort behaviours, such as preening and wing flapping, which have been associated with a state of relaxation. Our study shows that laying hens are able to anticipate differentially a positive, neutral and negative event announced by different sound cues. It is also the first study to identify comfort behaviours as specifically associated with anticipation of a positive event in domestic fowl. Comfort behaviours may therefore be associated with a positive emotional state in domestic fowl. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal welfare; classical conditioning; comfort behaviour; domestic fowl; Gallus gallus domesticus; learning; positive emotion",,,,,,,,"Zimmerman, P.H.; Department of Animal Environment and Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Swedenemail: patrick_zimmerman@hotmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.028,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

We examined the mate sampling strategy of the cricket Gryllus lineaticeps. In our first set of experiments, we simultaneously presented three different chirp rates to females. The set consisted of three trials, each covering a different range of chirp rates. Independent of chirp rate range, female G. lineaticeps preferred rates that were above 3.0 chirps/s to rates that were below 3.0 chirps/s. Females did not discriminate among chirp rates that were below this threshold and did not discriminate among chirp rates that were above this threshold, suggesting that they express a fixed threshold sampling strategy. In our second experiment, females were presented sequentially with a fast chirp rate and then a slow chirp rate. When the interval between presentations was 20 min, females showed significantly weaker responses to the slow rate than to the fast rate. However, when the interval between presentations was 24 h, female responses to the slow and fast rate did not significantly differ. The latter result suggests that females lower their threshold of acceptance when they have not recently experienced highly attractive song types. This lower acceptance threshold is probably adaptive, as it would allow females to avoid paying high search costs, and to reproduce, only when low-quality males are available. Our results are consistent with a rarely considered sampling strategy (fixed threshold with last chance option strategy) and highlights the importance of the timing of social experience for mate sampling. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic communication; female preference; fixed threshold strategy; Gryllus lineaticeps; last chance option; mate choice; search strategy",,,,,,,,"Beckers, O.M.; School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, U.S.A.email: beckersom@unlserve.unl.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.022,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

One reason for this is that such traits are often difficult to characterize among large numbers of individuals, without the influence of diverse environmental effects swamping intrinsic individual differences. We conducted standardized assays on a natural population of great tits, Parus major, to quantify and characterize individual variation in problem-solving performance, a simple cognitive trait often linked to innovative foraging ability. Forty-four per cent of 570 birds solved a food-motivated, lever-pulling problem and this proportion was consistent across three seasons. Individual performance was consistent within and across captivity sessions, across seasons, and between two different problem-solving tasks (lever and string pulling). Problem-solving performance was not explained by differences in latency to approach the empty task, nor latency to feed after human disturbance. Variation was unrelated to body condition, while age and natal origin explained significant but minimal amounts of variation, the importance of which varied between seasons. Problem-solving performance did not covary with exploration behaviour of a novel environment, suggesting that individual differences in problem solving represent an independent source of behavioural variation in our population. Rather than simply reflecting covariance with state or with other behavioural traits, our results suggest that variation in problem-solving performance represents inherent individual differences in the propensity to forage innovatively. We suggest that standardized problem-solving assays may prove ideal for studying the evolutionary ecology of simple cognitive traits. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","cognition; consistency; exploration behaviour; great tit; individual variation; innovation; neophobia; Parus major; personality; problem solving",,,,,,,,"Cole, E.F.; Edward Grey Institute, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, U.K.email: eleanor.cole@zoo.ox.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.025,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Understanding the mechanisms that underlie variation in maternal care can provide us with a more thorough understanding of the evolution of parental care. In some taxa, the effects of steroid hormones such as testosterone on paternal care have been well studied. However, patterns of female androgens in natural populations are rarely documented and relationships between maternal androgens and behaviour remain poorly studied. In this study, we first validated an enzyme immunoassay to measure faecal androgen metabolites (FAM) in territorial North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus. We validated this assay by demonstrating that (1) our antibody reacts with testosterone metabolites, (2) reproductive females have significantly higher FAM than nonreproductive females, and (3) patterns of FAM were largely mirrored in plasma androgen levels. Second, we tested the hypothesis that androgen concentrations drive behavioural trade-offs in free-ranging breeding female red squirrels during gestation and lactation using 3 years of FAM data and 10 years of behavioural observations. FAM increased after conception and parturition, peaked during mid-lactation around the time of juvenile emergence, and then declined during the remainder of lactation and after weaning. Around the peak of FAM during mid-lactation, nest use was lowest, while territory defence and time spent foraging were at their highest levels. These associations between maternal androgens and behaviour support the hypothesis that androgens may play an important role in mediating maternal behaviour in free-ranging animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","faecal assay; field endocrinology; life history trade-offs; maternal care; noninvasive technique; parental care; radiometabolism; territoriality",,,,,,,,"Dantzer, B.; Department of Zoology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, U.S.A.email: bendantzer@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.021,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

We created food patches to reveal monkeys' foraging cost of predation. We measured the monkeys' variation in predation costs with patches stratified by height and arrayed horizontally. We expected the monkeys to harvest the most from patches with the least substrate/most food, and to harvest the least from patches with the most substrate/least food. Furthermore, we predicted that giving-up densities (GUDs) would (1) decrease with greater height (2) increase on the ground when sightlines were blocked, and (3) in a landscape grid, decrease in patches near trees and increase in patches near shrubs. Monkeys harvested the most from the richest patches and the least from the poorest patches. Along a vertical axis, GUDs decreased by 15% from 0.1 m to 2 m, and by 10% from 2 m to 5 m. Along a horizontal axis, GUDs were affected by curtain-blocked sightlines (4.7% higher with curtains), but not by distances to vegetation. We demonstrated that the vertical landscape gradient is more meaningful to Sykes' monkeys than the terrestrial horizontal. We conclude that experiments with giving-up densities in depletable food patches provide effective means for studying primate ecology. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cercopithecus albogularis erythrarchus; giving-up density; landscape of fear; patch use; predation risk; primate foraging; samango monkey; Sykes' monkey",,,,,,,,"Emerson, S.E.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, U.S.A.email: semers1@uic.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.018,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Biological market theory makes specific predictions about the occurrence of reciprocity in social groups; applied to the social grooming of mammals, it predicts reciprocity in the absence of other benefits for which grooming can be exchanged. Considerable effort has been made to test this grooming trade model in nonhuman primates; such studies show mixed results, but may be confounded by kin effects. We examined patterns of reciprocity within and across bouts, and tested predictions of the grooming trade model, among wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes: a system with negligible kin effects. In accord with the model's expectations, we found that some grooming was directed by lower- to higher-ranked individuals, and that, on average, higher-ranked individuals groomed more reciprocally. We found no support, however, for a prediction that more reciprocity should occur between individuals close in rank. For most dyads, reciprocity of effort occurred through unbalanced participation in grooming bouts, but reciprocity varied considerably between dyads and only a small proportion showed strongly reciprocal grooming. Despite this, each male had at least one reciprocal grooming relationship. In bouts where both individuals groomed, effort was matched through mutual grooming, not alternating roles. Our results provide mixed support for the current grooming trade, biological market model, and suggest that it needs to incorporate risks of currency inflation and cheating for species where reciprocity can be achieved through repeated dyadic interactions. © 2010.","altruism; biological market theory; Budongo; chimpanzee; grooming; Pan troglodytes",,,,,,,,"Newton-Fisher, N.E.; School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, U.K.email: n.e.newton-fisher@kent.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.015,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

We investigated learning behaviour and autonomic reactions, including heart rate (HR) and its variability (standard deviation (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of a time series of interbeat intervals). Twenty-four domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, housed in six groups of four, were confronted with a cognitive challenge integrated into their familiar housing environment. Pigs were rewarded with food after they mastered the discrimination of an individual acoustic signal followed by an operant task. All pigs quickly learned the tasks, while baseline SDNN and RMSSD increased significantly throughout the experiment. In reaction to the signals, pigs showed a sudden increase in HR, SDNN and RMSSD, and a decrease in the RMSSD/SDNN ratio. Immediately after this reaction, the HR and SDNN decreased, and the RMSSD/SDNN ratio increased. During feeding, the HR and the RMSSD/SDNN ratio stayed elevated. The pigs showed no cardiac reaction to the sound signals for other pigs or their feeding pen mates. We concluded that the level of cognitive challenge was adequate and that the observed changes in the autonomic tone, which are related to different dimensions of the affective response (e.g. arousal and valence), indicated arousal and positive affective appraisal by the pigs. These findings provide valuable insight into the assessment of positive emotions in animals and support the use of an adequate cognitive enrichment to improve animal welfare. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal welfare; autonomic nervous system; cognition; emotion; environmental enrichment; heart rate variability; operant conditioning; Sus scrofa",,,,,,,,"Puppe, B.; Research Unit Behavioural Physiology, Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN), Germanyemail: puppe@fbn-dummerstorf.de",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.023,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

We used behavioural recognition tests and cuticle chemical investigation to elucidate the role of endogenous and environmentally based cues for nestmate recognition in the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia. We found that although newly emerged workers present specific cuticle patterns according to their nest origin, these compounds are not used for nestmate recognition, since newly emerged workers are broadly accepted in different colonies. The cerumen used in nest construction played an important role in recognition behaviour. Twenty minutes of contact with foreign cerumen was sufficient to increase the rejection rates of nestmates and separate the groups of workers according to their chemical profile.

Immune defence is particularly relevant to survival in migratory bands, but little is known about the role of nutrition in insect immunity, particularly in nature. We hypothesized that immune defences are compromised in Mormon cricket bands because of nutrient limitations. Members of a migratory band in Nevada, U.S.A., preferred carbohydrate diets over proteins. After feeding on the carbohydrate diet, migratory velocity was less and the ability to encapsulate foreign particles and lyse bacteria was greater than for Mormon crickets consuming protein. Less locomotory demand for lipids may result in greater antibacterial activity. Total phenoloxidase (PO) activity also increased following feeding on carbohydrates, whereas spontaneously active PO was not different between the two diets. These results were very different from those of a band in Utah, U.S.A., that preferred the protein diet and that had enhanced spontaneous PO activity after protein supplementation. Haemolymph of Mormon crickets from the Nevada band was sampled 18 h after the diet treatments, whereas that from the Utah band was drawn 4 h after treatment. Either the difference in immune measures was due to the difference in sampling time, or spontaneous PO activity was protein-limited whereas encapsulation and antibacterial activity required carbohydrates. Currencies for the generalized immunity of insects may differ, and constraints on immunity in a given environment depend on which macronutrients are in short supply.","diet; encapsulation; life history; lysozyme; nutrition; phenoloxidase",,,,,,,,"Srygley, R.B.; USDA-Agricultural Research Service, 1500 N.

Nearly all studies of status signals to date have focused on single signalling traits, and most studies that have investigated multiple traits did not examine whether different traits are used in different contexts, as is required for them to function as multiple signals. We examined the role of gold and black crown patches of wintering golden-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia atricapilla, in determining social dominance during experimentally staged encounters between unfamiliar individuals. Specifically, we determined whether variation in weakly correlated or uncorrelated traits (crown patch size and colour, body size) differentially affected the outcome of interactions involving avoidance versus aggression. Overall, crown patch size and colour were better predictors of dominance than were body size or sex. Several traits, including both crown features and morphological traits, predicted which individual avoided the other in dyadic interactions that did not escalate beyond avoidance. However, when dyads had similar gold crown patch sizes, the interaction was more likely to escalate, leading to aggression. In contrast to avoidance interactions, the outcomes of aggressive contests were largely predicted by variation in the colour of black crown patches. Taken together, our results show that gold and black crown features operate as multiple status signals that accommodate an escalated gradient of interactions and suggest that social status involves more complexity than can be accommodated by a single signal. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","carotenoid; escalated contest; golden-crowned sparrow; melanin; multiple signals; plumage; social dominance; status signal; winter flock; Zonotrichia atricapilla",,,,,,,,"Chaine, A.S.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.email: alexis.chaine@ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.016,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Here, we use algorithms designed to parse human speech to test different approaches for categorizing calls of killer whales. Killer whale vocalizations have traditionally been categorized by humans into discrete call types. These calls often contain internal spectral shifts, periods of silence and synchronously produced low- and high-frequency components, suggesting that they may be composed of subunits. We describe and compare three different approaches for modelling Norwegian killer whale calls. The first method considered the whole call as the basic unit of analysis. Inspired by human speech-processing techniques, the second and third methods represented the calls in terms of subunits. Subunits may provide a more parsimonious approach to modelling the vocal stream of Norwegian killer whale calls since (1) there were fewer subunits than call types and (2) nearly 75% of all call types shared at least one subunit. We show that contour traces from stereotyped Norwegian killer whale calls yielded similar automatic classification performance using either whole calls or subunits. We also demonstrate that subunits derived from Norwegian stereotyped calls were detected in some Norwegian variable (nonstereotyped) calls as well as the stereotyped calls of other killer whale populations. Further work is required to test whether killer whales use subunits to generate and categorize their vocal repertoire. © 2010.","call type; killer whale; subunit; vocalization",,,,,,,,"Shapiro, A.D.; Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, U.S.A.email: ashapiro@whoi.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.020,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Although this flexible lifestyle permits individuals to reduce conflicts of interest, it simultaneously imposes a unique set of challenges on group members that are regularly subject to prolonged separation. Theory predicts animals should evolve ritualized and risky displays to quickly update relationships at reunions. Here we investigated the function of nonconciliatory greetings among adult female spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, belonging to a single, large female-dominated social group in Kenya. We tested three hypotheses forwarded to explain the occurrence of these multimodal signals: formal submission, tension reduction and social bonding hypotheses. In contrast to predictions of the formal submission hypothesis, rank distance and relative rank were excluded from our best model predicting greetings among adult females. Moreover, directional consistency of greetings was low (0.65) compared to that of submissive behaviours during dyadic agonistic interactions (0.97). Instead, our data revealed that adult females greeted coalition partners and close associates, including kin, most often per opportunity, and they did so in neutral contexts more frequently than in situations characterized by social tension. Although these findings are in direct contrast to the predictions of the tension reduction and formal submission hypotheses, they strongly support the social bonding hypothesis. Importantly, the immediate act of greeting promoted cooperation among allies during intragroup and intergroup coalition formation. Thus, these risky, multimodal signals permit hyaenas to effectively communicate cooperative affiliations within a continuously shifting social milieu. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alliance; association index; coalition; dominance hierarchy; fission-fusion society; honest signalling; kinship; multimodal signalling",,,,,,,,"Smith, J.E.; Department of Zoology and Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Behavior, Michigan State University, Easemail: smith.jennifer.elaine@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.007,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Field observations and experiments provide evidence for the existence of traditions in animals but they do not address the underlying social-learning mechanisms. We used an established laboratory experimental paradigm, the artificial fruit design, to test for copying of a sequence of actions and local enhancement in six groups of wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops. We introduced a two-step task where models had to remove a bar to untie a rope that blocked a single door of a box. The models were high-ranking individuals that monopolized the box early on and discovered by trial and error how to open it. We obtained successful models in three groups, while the other three groups acted as controls. After 20 successful demonstrations, we tested subjects with a box that had a rope in the same position but the rope was not functional. Under these conditions, sequential copying of the two-step opening did not occur. Only individuals that were exposed to models were likely to touch the bar if door opening was not immediately successful, providing evidence for local enhancement. When we presented the boxes with the functional rope, we found no effect of having been exposed to a model on the probability that subjects solved the task. We conclude that the social-learning abilities of wild vervet monkeys are relatively limited and discuss potential problems concerning the technical difficulty of the task. © 2010.","artificial fruit; Chlorocebus aethiops; field experiment; local enhancement; manipulation task solving; social learning; tradition; vervet monkey",,,,,,,,"van de Waal, E.; Institute of Biology, University of Neuchâtel, Switzerlandemail: erica.vandewaal@unine.ch",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.013,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

The classic examples of such adaptive manipulations typically concern trophically transmitted parasites that increase host conspicuousness or in other ways maximize the likelihood of their intermediate host being consumed by the parasite's predatory definitive host, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. However, examples of manipulations not involving trophically transmitted parasites are rare. Here we present evidence of a novel parasite-induced change in host coloration that we suggest acts as a warning signal to deter predators from consuming infected hosts, which would result in termination of the parasite's life cycle. When insect larvae are infected by the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora they become bioluminescent and change to a vivid pink-red colour. We used field trials involving wild European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and showed that infected larvae were rarely handled by these avian predators and, on the rare occasions that infected larvae were handled, they tended to be rejected. Our results suggest that the parasite-induced colour change in the host may act as a visual deterrent or warning signal to avian predators, which may be reinforced by the production of a distasteful chemical that, together, reduce the likelihood of infected prey being consumed. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a parasite-induced host manipulation involving warning coloration, and so broadens the range of examples of this fascinating adaptive behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aposematism; dietary conservatism; entomopathogenic nematode; extended phenotype; foraging; Heterorhabditis bacteriophora; neophobia; parasite transmission; predation",,,,,,,,"Fenton, A.; Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, U.K.email: a.fenton@liverpool.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.010,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

At garden bird feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season. Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After 2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2 weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","birdsong; foraging; great tit; laying date; Parus major; song length; territorial intruder; territory defence; urban ecology; urbanization No items selected",,,,,,,,"Amrhein, V.; Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Switzerlandemail: v.amrhein@unibas.ch",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.008,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Courtship displays of male Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) wolf spiders are multimodal, consisting of visual and seismic signals. The microhabitat of S. ocreata is complex, including leaf litter, wood/bark, soil and rocks. Results from laser vibrometer measurements in the present study indicated that leaf litter transmitted male courtship signals with greater efficacy. Mating success was significantly greater on leaf litter (∼85%) compared to other substrates (∼30%), even though latency to male courtship did not vary among substrates. Given these results, selection should favour spiders that increase their mating potential on nonconducting substrates. We tested whether spiders detect substrate differences in a choice test, and found that when males and females visited all substrates, they spent significantly more time on leaf litter. We isolated courting male spiders on each substrate and scored courtship behaviours to see whether signals varied with substrate. Males used significantly more visual signals (waves and arches) on substrates that attenuated seismic signals (soil and rocks), but other behaviours showed no differences. Taken together, these results suggest that combined visual/seismic components of multimodal displays may serve as 'backup signals', ensuring reception under different environmental conditions. Results also suggest that male S. ocreata have the flexibility to compensate for environmental constraints by seeking microhabitats with more effective vibration conduction properties, and/or by increasing visual signals on substrates where seismic communication is less effective. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","arthropod communication; Lycosidae; multimodal signal; seismic signal; substrate; vibration; wolf spider",,,,,,,,"Gordon, S.D.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati, U.S.A.email: shira.gordon@eee.strath.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.003,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Hence, insect behaviour is often characterized by olfactory plasticity. Mechanisms triggering changes in the postmating behaviour of insect females are typically mediated by constituents of the male ejaculate. Here we show that the behavioural switch displayed by mated females of the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis in response to a male abdominal sex pheromone is independent of the transfer of a male ejaculate. Rather, our results suggest a pheromone interaction in that prior exposure of a female to one pheromone and her subsequent receptivity signal modulated her response to a second one. We tested the pheromone response of females that had been experimentally prevented from receiving sperm or from experiencing certain elements of the male courtship behaviour. We show that the behavioural switch in N. vitripennis females is linked to the receptivity signal shown by females in response to a male-derived oral aphrodisiac during precopulatory courtship. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Courtship behaviour; Nasonia vitripennis; Olfactory plasticity; Parasitic wasp; Parasitoid; Sex pheromone","behavioral response; chemical cue; copulation; courtship; female; olfaction; perception; phenotypic plasticity; sex pheromone; signaling; wasp; Hexapoda; Nasonia vitripennis; Vespoidea",,,,,,"Abdel-latief, M., Garbe, L.-A., Koch, M., Ruther, J., An epoxide hydrolase involved in the biosynthesis of an insect sex attractant and its use to localize the production site (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 105, pp. 8914-8919; Anton, S., Gadenne, C., Effect of juvenile hormone on the central nervous processing of sex pheromone in an insect (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 96, pp. 5764-5767; Anton, S., Dufour, M.C., Gadenne, C., Plasticity of olfactory-guided behaviour and its neurobiological basis: lessons from moths and locusts (2007) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 123, pp. 1-11; van den Assem, J., Mating behaviour in parasitic wasps (1986) Insect Parasitoids, pp. 137-167. , Academic Press, London, J.

These substances can damage DNA and tissue, and probably are major causes of mutation, ageing and a host of diseases. Oxidative stress occurs when an organism produces an overabundance of ROS relative to ROS-neutralizing antioxidants. In this study, we examined the hypotheses that individual differences in oxidative stress are associated with fluctuating asymmetry and with perceived mate quality. We measured urinary biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) in a sample of healthy, young men and tested their association with fluctuating asymmetry and physical attractiveness. A composite measure of oxidative stress correlated positively with FA and negatively with physical attractiveness (with exposure to toxins, smoking, and their interaction statistically controlled for). Follow-up analyses yielded associations of oxidative stress with both healthy and masculine appearance. No association was mediated by cortisol or testosterone. These findings may yield insights into previously unidentified factors that affect the development of phenotypic features under sexual selection and contribute to the shape of human life histories, and have potential implications for other species as well. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Fluctuating asymmetry; Oxidative stress; Physical attractiveness; Reactive oxygen species; Sexual selection","aging; aldehyde; antioxidant; biomarker; fluctuating asymmetry; hominid; individual variation; life history; male; morphology; mutation; oxidation; phenotype; sexual selection",,,,,,"Al-Aubaidy, H.A., Jelinek, H.F., Hydoxy-2-deoxy-guanosine identifies oxidative damage in a rural prediabetes cohort (2010) Redox Report, 15, pp. 155-160; Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Devevey, G., Gaillard, M., Prost, J., Faivre, B., Sorci, G., Increased susceptibility to oxidative stress as a proximate cost of reproduction (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 363-368; Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Faivre, B., Chastel, O., Sorci, G., Testosterone and oxidative stress: the oxidation handicap hypothesis (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 264, pp. 819-825; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Beckman, K.B., Ames, B.N., The free radical theory of aging matures (1998) Physiological Reviews, 78, pp. 547-581; Bloomer, R.J., Fisher-Wellman, K.H., Blood oxidative stress biomarkers: influences of sex, exercise training status, and dietary intake (2008) Gender Medicine, 5, pp. 218-228; Brown, G.R., Laland, K.N., Borgerhoff Mulder, M., Bateman's principles and human sex roles (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 297-304; Carter, A.J.R., Weier, T.M., Houle, D., The effect of inbreeding on fluctuating asymmetry of wing veins in two laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster (2009) Heredity, 102, pp. 563-572; Chandramathi, S., Sureth, K., Anita, Z.B., Kuppusamy, U.R., Elevated levels of urinary hydrogen peroxide, advanced oxidative protein product (AOPP) and malondialdehyde in humans infected with intestinal parasites (2009) Parasitology, 136, pp. 359-363; Chenoweth, S.F., Doughty, P., Kokko, H., Can non-directional male mating preferences facilitate female ornamentation?

In the present study, we developed a new behavioural test, to characterize selective attention towards humans. In the task, the dogs were exposed to the owner and an unfamiliar person, repeatedly entering the experimental room and leaving through different doors; at the end of the sequence the dogs were allowed to approach the doors. Attention was measured as the average length of gaze bouts and as the overall duration of visual orientation towards the different targets. Dogs gave preferential attention to the owner, who received longer gaze bouts and greater overall attention than the stranger. The preference was confirmed by the significant proportion of dogs that directed attention to the owner's door at the end of the task. A modified version of the task was employed to measure dogs' attention when the person's head was not visible. This condition caused a decrease in attention parameters towards the owner. To determine the effects of old age on attention, the two tasks were then administered to dogs aged 7 years and older. Compared to adults, aged dogs showed lower owner-directed attention when the owner was not in sight and were more likely not to move at the end of the task. The results provide the first evidence that dogs' interspecific attention depends on the nature of the dog-human relationship, on the availability of some distinctive features of the social stimulus and on the age of the dog. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural test; Canis familiaris; Dog; Dog ageing; Dog-human relationship; Social attention","adaptation; aging; behavioral response; canid; experimental study; nature-society relations; orientation behavior; public attitude; selection; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Adachi, I., Kuwahata, H., Fujita, K., Dogs recall their owner's face upon hearing the owner's voice (2007) Animal Cognition, 10, pp. 17-21; Adams, B., Chan, A., Callahan, H., Milgram, N.W., The canine as a model of human cognitive ageing: recent developments (2000) Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry, 24, pp. 675-692; Araujo, J.A., Studzinski, C.M., Milgram, N.W., Further evidence for the cholinergic hypothesis of ageing and dementia from the canine model of ageing (2005) Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry, 29, pp. 411-422; Call, J., Brauer, J., Kaminski, J., Tomasello, M., Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are sensitive to the attentional state of humans (2003) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 117, pp. 257-263; Elgier, M.A., Jakovcevic, A., Mustaca, A.E., Bentosela, M., Learning and owner-stranger effects on interspecific communication in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) (2009) Behavioural Processes, 81, pp. 44-49; Fiset, S., Beaulieu, C., Landry, F., Duration of dogs' (Canis familiaris) working memory in search for disappearing objects (2003) Animal Cognition, 6, pp. 1-10; Fukuzawa, M., Mills, D.S., Cooper, J.J., More than just a word: non-semantic command variables affect obedience in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) (2005) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 91, pp. 129-141; Gácsi, M., Miklósi, Á., Varga, O., Topál, J., Csányi, V., Are readers of our face readers of our minds?

We examined this issue in experimental two-chick broods of the barn owl, Tyto alba, a species in which siblings communicate vocally with each other in the prolonged absence of parents. The function of sib-sib vocal communication, so-called sibling negotiation, is to resolve conflicts over which individual will have priority of access to the next delivered indivisible food item. We found that when a nestling produced longer negotiation calls and stood closer to the nestbox entrance in the absence of parents, its sibling vocally negotiated at a lower rate. Additionally, when an individual produced more negotiation calls in the absence of parents, its sibling begged less intensely at the parent's return, with begging being the key factor that determined which nestling obtained a food item. We conclude that position in the nest and the duration of negotiation calls produced in the absence of parents influence the rate of producing negotiation calls, which in turn influences the rate at which siblings beg for food from their parents. Adjusting begging behaviour could therefore depend on complex sib-sib interactions taking place in the prolonged absence of parents. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Barn owl; Begging; Communication; Negotiation; Scramble competition; Sib-sib competition; Tyto alba","begging behavior; honest signaling; nest box; nestling; parental care; raptor; resource allocation; scramble competition; sibling; vocalization; Strigiformes; Tyto alba; Tytonidae",,,,,,"Bachman, G.C., Chappell, M.A., The energetic cost of begging behaviour in nestling house wrens (1998) Animal Behaviour, 55, pp. 1607-1618; Bell, M.B.V., Cooperative begging in banded mongoose pups (2007) Current Biology, 17, pp. 717-721; Boersma, P.D., Davis, L.S., Feeding chases and food allocation in Adélie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae (1997) Animal Behaviour, 54, pp. 1047-1052; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Learning during competitive positioning in the nest: do nestlings use ideal free 'foraging' tactics?

Some orb web spiders build multiple structures or build in aggregations, which may have the same effect on prey capture success as the addition of a structure. As these structures often appear together, they may bestow interactive benefits not realized if the structures were added alone. We performed field experiments to investigate whether the multiple structures associated with the orb webs of two spider species provide interactive benefits. The orb web spider Nephila clavata adds barrier webs and prey carcass decorations to its webs. We manipulated their webs in the field by removing either, both or neither the barrier webs or the carcass decorations. We found that prey interception rate was greatest when neither barrier webs nor carcasses were present but, for the prey caught, the prey retention rate was greatest with both structures present. Another orb web spider, Cyclosa mulmeinensis, adds prey carcass decorations and forms aggregations. We manipulated the decorations and aggregations of C. mulmeinensis in the field to determine their interactive influences. In solitary webs and webs with decorations, prey capture rates were lower than those without structures. These negative foraging effects, however, did not exist in decorated webs that were in aggregations. Our results thus show that multiple structures, individually, are costly, but interactively they provide substantial benefits. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggregation;

The main problem in most theories of cooperation is how a cooperative player selects individuals to 'trust' so that he does not get exploited by noncooperators. While early models emphasized the role of direct experience with individuals in deciding who to trust, more recent work has shown that individuals can eavesdrop on interactions between other individuals to identify cooperators and noncooperators. This second route to cooperation is called indirect reciprocity. In spatially structured populations with repeated interactions between players, both sources of information (direct experience and observed reputation) are readily available. Most models and empirical studies to date, however, have considered indirect reciprocity only in one-shot interactions when direct experience is not available. We examined the role of indirect reciprocity in the maintenance of mutual restraint in aggression (Dear Enemy cooperation) between territorial male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. We found that territory owners eavesdropped on simulated defections by a neighbour (intrusions onto a third bird's territory) and subsequently retaliated against these defecting neighbours. Taken together with our previous results, these results suggest that both direct and indirect reciprocity can be at work in repeated-interaction scenarios, and together lead to emergence of cooperation. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Communication network; Eavesdropping; Indirect reciprocity; Prisoner's Dilemma; Territoriality","communication behavior; cooperative behavior; dear enemy phenomenon; evolutionary biology; numerical model; prisoner dilemma; reciprocity; songbird; territoriality; Aves; Melospiza; Melospiza melodia",,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Territory size and shape in fire ants: a model based on neighborhood interactions (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 1125-1134; Adams, E.S., Approaches to the study of territory size and shape (2001) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 32, pp. 277-303; Akçay, Ç., Wood, W.E., Searcy, W.A., Templeton, C.N., Campbell, S.E., Beecher, M.D., Good neighbour, bad neighbour: song sparrows retaliate against aggressive rivals (2009) Animal Behaviour, 78, pp. 97-102; Alexander, R.D., (1987) The Biology of Moral Systems, , de Gruyter, New York; Axelrod, R., (1984) The Evolution of Cooperation, , Basic Books, New York; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Bshary, R., Grutter, A.S., Image scoring and cooperation in a cleaner fish mutualism (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 975-978; Burt, J.M., Vehrencamp, S.L., Dawn chorus as an interactive communication network (2005) Animal Communication Networks, pp. 320-343. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, P.K.

We tested whether the activation of a male's immune system has an effect on the female's mate choice in Tenebrio molitor. We found that after a single parasite-like activation of their immune system by a nylon monofilament, males did not suffer from increased mortality but their ability to attract a mate was reduced. However, after a repeated immune challenge, the females more often chose the treatment males, although these males later suffered a high mortality rate, suggesting terminal investment in sexual signalling. The reduced encapsulation response against the nylon implant and reduced survival of these males suggest they did not invest in recovery of their immune system. Our results suggest that under terminal investment males preferred by females may signal their condition dishonestly. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Immune challenge; Mealworm beetle; Sexual selection; Tenebrio molitor; Terminal investment","beetle; encapsulation; evolutionary theory; honest signaling; host-parasite interaction; immune system; immunocompetence; life history trait; mate choice; mortality; reproductive cost; sexual selection; survival; Coleoptera; Tenebrio; Tenebrio molitor",,,,,,"Ahtiainen, J.J., Alatalo, R.V., Kortet, R., Rantala, M.J., Sexual advertisement and immune function in an arachnid species (Lycosideae) (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 602-606; Ahtiainen, J.J., Alatalo, R.V., Kortet, R., Rantala, M.J., A trade-off between immune function and sexual signaling in a wild population of the drumming wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 985-991; August, C.J., The role of male and female pheromones in the mating behaviour of Tenebrio molitor (1971) Journal of Insect Physiology, 17, pp. 739-751; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Bhattacharya, A.K., Ameel, J.J., Waldbaer, G.P., A method for sexing living pupal and adult yellow mealworms (1970) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 63, p. 1783; Bonneaud, C., Mazuc, J., Chastel, O., Westerdahl, H., Sorci, G., Terminal investment induced by immune-challenge and fitness traits associated with major histocompatibility complex in the house sparrow (2004) Evolution, 58, pp. 2823-2830; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Reproductive effort and terminal investment in iteroparous animals (1984) American Naturalist, 123, pp. 212-229; Creighton, J.C., Heflin, N.D., Belk, M.C., Cost of reproduction, resource quality, and terminal investment in a burying beetle (2009) American Naturalist, 174, pp. 673-684; Dawkins, R., Krebs, J.R., Animal signals: information or manipulation?

Our work aimed at assessing behavioural consistency in a social insect: the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We focused on a behavioural dimension commonly used in personality studies: the response of an individual to novelty (neophilia/neophobia spectrum). We used a foraging paradigm to quantify individual bees' response to novel flower colours and to assess the repeatability of this response over time. As for vertebrates, most individual bumblebees responded to a novel stimulus by increasing the time they spent investigating it compared to known stimuli. Using a new statistical approach, the consistency model, we found that individual bees tended to be consistent in their response to novelty over a few hours but were not consistent in their behaviour over 3 days. We conclude that for the neophilia/neophobia paradigm used here, bumblebee foragers do not fulfil the criteria for animal personality in the common sense of the term. Instead their behavioural response to novelty appears to be plastic, varying on a day to day basis. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bombus terrestris; Bumblebee; Episodic personality; Neophilia; Neophobia; Repeatability","bee; behavioral response; color; foraging behavior; individual variation; numerical model; social insect; statistical analysis; Animalia; Apoidea; Bombus terrestris; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Bell, A., Future directions in behavioural syndromes research (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 755-761; Bell, A., Sih, A., Exposure to predation generates personality in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 828-834; Bolnick, D., Svanback, R., Fordyce, J., Yang, L., Davis, J., Darrin Hulsey, C., Forister, M., The ecology of individuals, incidence and implications of individual specialization (2003) American Naturalist, 161, pp. 1-28; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (with discussion) (1964) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 26, pp. 211-252; Briffa, M., Rundle, S., Fryer, A., Comparing the strength of behavioural plasticity and consistency across situations: animal personalities in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 375, pp. 1305-1311; Burns, J., Dyer, A.G., Diversity of speed-accuracy strategies benefits social insects (2008) Current Biology, 18, pp. R953-R954; Chittka, L., The colour hexagon: a chromaticity diagram based on photoreceptor excitations as a generalized representation of colour opponency (1992) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 170, pp. 533-543; Chittka, L., Thomson, J.D., Waser, N.M., Flower constancy, insect physiology, and plant evolution (1999) Naturwissenschaften, 86, pp. 361-377; Dingemanse, N.J., Both, C., Drent, P., Tinbergen, J., Fitness consequences of avian personalities in a fluctuating environment (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. 847-852; Dochtermann, N., Jenkins, S., Behavioural syndromes in Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami): a test of competing hypotheses (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 2346-2349; Dyer, A.G., Chittka, L., Fine colour discrimination requires differential conditioning in bumblebees (2004) Naturwissenschaften, 91, pp. 228-231; Forrest, J., Thomson, J.D., Pollinator experience, neophobia and the evolution of flowering time (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 276, pp. 935-943; von Frisch, K., (1967) The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Giurfa, M., Núňez, J., Chittka, L., Menzel, R., Colour preferences of flower-naive honeybees (1995) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 177, pp. 247-259; Goulson, D., (2003) Bumblebees: Their Behaviour and Ecology, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Goulson, D., Peat, J., Stout, J., Tucker, J., Darvill, B., Derwent, L., Hughes, W., Can alloethism in workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, be explained in terms of foraging efficiency?

We hypothesized that, under these conditions, individuals of a social species such as European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, would be more responsive to social cues indicating food presence than individuals belonging to populations already established in a well-known habitat. To test this hypothesis, we displayed starling decoys with various age, group size and interindividual distance characteristics in feeding postures to evaluate their attractiveness to starlings from towns and colonization fronts and noted whether attracted individuals joined particular decoy groups. Our results supported our hypothesis that sensitivity to social cues varied according to the population's history, and we suggest that these cues enhance the success of starlings in occupying new habitats. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Biological invasion; Colonization; Decoy; European starling; Local enhancement; Social cue; Social information; Sturnus vulgaris","age class; behavioral response; biological invasion; colonization; experimental study; food availability; group size; habitat structure; hypothesis testing; passerine; Sturnidae; Sturnus vulgaris",,,,,,"Adret-Hausberger, M., Cumming, R.B., Social attraction to older birds by domestic chicks (1987) Bird Behavior, 7, pp. 44-46; Bautista, L.M., Tinbergen, J., Wiersma, P., Kacelnik, A., Optimal foraging and beyond: how starlings cope with changes in food availability (1998) American Naturalist, 152, pp. 543-561; Beauchamp, G., Ruxton, G., Harvesting resources in groups or alone: the case of renewing patches (2005) Behavioral Ecology, 16, pp. 989-993; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., An evolutionary model of social learning: the effects of spatial and temporal variation (1988) Social Learning: Psychological and Biological Approaches, pp. 29-48. , L.

We designed a study to investigate the effects of changing both the amplitude and duration of an acoustic stimulus on distraction in a terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus). In experiment 1, we replicated the key findings from a field result: crabs hid more slowly in response to a silent visual stimulus when we simultaneously broadcast a white noise than they did when in a silent condition. In experiment 2, we altered the noise duration and found that a long noise generated greater latencies to hide than a short noise. In experiment 3, we increased the noise amplitude and found that hide latency increased with higher-intensity auditory stimuli. These experiments demonstrate a variety of stimulus factors that influence distraction. Our results suggest that prey animals could be in greater danger from predators when in an environment with auditory distractions. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Attention;

However, the male signal, rather than merely providing raw material for female evaluation, may actively modulate a female's intrinsic preferences or decision-making capabilities in favour of a given male. We propose two broad mechanisms by which male signals could modulate female behaviour: (1) specific augmentation of sexual motivation or (2) heightened general arousal. Specifically, we investigated the ability of a generic male pheromone mix to elicit changes in general activity or affinity for different classes of stimuli in female terrestrial salamanders (Plethodon shermani). Attraction to male olfactory stimuli was significantly increased by pheromones, but attraction to visual stimuli and nonsexual olfactory stimuli remained unaffected, as did locomotor activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sex pheromones activate specific behavioural subsystems associated with augmented sexual motivation. This pheromone action may still function within the context of information-transfer signalling, for example, if pheromones influence female choice by affecting (1) sensory processing of relevant stimuli, (2) the value assigned to a set of sexual stimuli, or (3) the criteria used to decide whether to mate. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Amphibian; Animal signal; Chemical communication; Female preference; Locomotion; Mate choice; Pheromone; Plethodon shermani; Red-legged salamander; Sexual motivation","amphibian; chemical cue; decision making; female behavior; hypothesis testing; locomotion; mate choice; olfactory cue; preference behavior; sex pheromone; signal; visual cue; Amphibia; Animalia; Plethodon; Plethodon shermani; Salamandroidea",,,,,,"Aisenberg, A., Costa, F.G., Females mated without sperm transfer maintain high sexual receptivity in the wolf spider Schizocosa malitiosa (2005) Ethology, 111, pp. 545-558; Alonzo, S.H., Sinervo, B., Mate choice games, context-dependent good genes, and genetic cycles in the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 49, pp. 176-186; Arnold, S.J., Sexual behavior, sexual interference and sexual defense in the salamanders Ambystoma maculatum, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Plethodon jordani (1976) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 42, pp. 247-300; Arnold, S.J., The evolution of courtship behavior in new world salamanders with some comments on old world salamandrids (1977) The Reproductive Biology of Amphibians, pp. 141-184. , Plenum, New York, S.

From an evolutionary perspective, it is therefore puzzling that the tool use behaviour of their closest living primate relative, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, has been described as particularly poor. However, only a small number of bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users in most contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the chimpanzee and bonobo data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Culture; Great ape; Neoteny; Pan; Primate evolution; Sex difference; Tool use","age class; behavioral ecology; captive population; comparative study; evolutionary biology; hypothesis testing; phylogeny; primate; sex-related difference; sexual maturity; tool use; Hominidae; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Primates",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Beck, B.B., (1980) Animal Tool Use, , Garland Press, New York; Boesch, C., Boesch, H., Tool use and tool making in wild chimpanzees (1990) Folia Primatologica, 54, pp. 86-99; Breuer, T., Ndoundou-Hockemba, M., Fishlock, V., First observation of tool use in wild gorillas (2005) PLoS Biology, 3, pp. 2041-2043; Bruner, J., The nature and uses of immaturity (1972) American Psychologist, 27, pp. 687-708; Byrne, R.W., Animal cognition: bring me my spear (2007) Current Biology, 17, pp. R164-R165; Crockford, C., Herbinger, I., Vigilant, L., Boesch, C., Wild chimpanzees produce group-specific calls: a case for vocal learning?

We studied the process of colony foundation in a long-term monitored population of lesser kestrels, Falco naumanni. For this purpose, we first analysed which habitat/demographic features influence the occupation of empty habitat patches experimentally supplied with nestboxes. Second, we studied the individual characteristics of founders and the reproductive consequences of occupation of new breeding patches in comparison with individuals settled in already established colonies. We found that the probability of occupation of experimental breeding patches increased with the relative cover of cereal crops. Regardless of sex, founders and individuals that settled in pre-existing colonies did not differ in body condition or age. However, there was a higher proportion of unringed kestrels in new than in pre-existing colonies, suggesting that founders are mostly immigrants from distant populations. Founders and nonfounders had similar breeding success, but the former had a lower parasitic burden of feather lice, indicating that occupying new breeding patches could reduce parasite pressure and/or transmission. Our results suggest habitat characteristics influence settlement decisions in the absence of pre-existing social cues, but do not support the idea that founders are suboptimal individuals unable to gain access to previously established colonies. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Breeding performance; Colonial breeding; Colonization; Connectivity; Ectoparasitism; Falco naumanni; Founder individual; Habitat selection; Lesser kestrel","bird; body condition; breeding site; cereal; colonization; colony founding; connectivity; decision making; demography; ectoparasite; habitat selection; nest box; patchiness; population distribution; reproductive success; Falco naumanni; Phthiraptera",,,,,,"Aebischer, N.J., Robertson, P.A., Kenward, R.E., Compositional analysis of habitat use from animal radio-tracking data (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 1313-1325; Alexander, R.D., The evolution of social behavior (1974) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 5, pp. 325-383; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., Regulation and stability of host-parasite population interactions: I.

Verification of traditions requires documentation that socially mediated learning contributes to acquisition by new practitioners. We investigated the emergence and maintenance of a foraging tradition in two generations of infant tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) in captive social groups. In baseline, we provided the first cohort of infants with a foraging apparatus that dispensed juice via two methods inside a small enclosure away from adult interference (the crèche). Later in phase 1, we provided a second apparatus to all group members with only one method of solution available (in the group setting); the crèche apparatus, with both methods available, remained accessible to infants only. Two years later (phase 2), we replicated phase 1 with a new cohort of infants from the same social groups. As adult activity and expertise with the apparatus increased across baseline (no adult activity), phase 1 (initially unskilled) and phase 2 (initially skilled), the proportion of infants in each cohort that acquired the foraging skill increased and their latency to skill acquisition decreased. Despite ambiguous evidence that the infants conformed to the specific method of solution common in their group, the social context clearly contributed to the development and maintenance of a general foraging tradition. The results provide support for the existence of traditions in wild capuchin groups. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Capuchin; Cebus; Conformity; Foraging; Habit formation; Skill acquisition; Socially mediated learning; Tradition","adult; captive population; foraging behavior; learning; primate; social behavior; Cebidae; Cebus; Cebus apella",,,,,,"Agostini, I., Visalberghi, E., Social influences on the acquisition of sex-typical foraging patterns by juveniles in a group of wild tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus nigritus) (2005) American Journal of Primatology, 65, pp. 335-351; Aisner, R., Terkel, J., Ontogeny of pine cone opening behavior in the black rat, Rattus rattus (1992) Animal Behaviour, 44, pp. 327-336; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-265; Biro, D., Inoue-Nakamura, N., Tonooka, R., Yamakoshi, G., Sousa, C., Matsuzawa, T., Cultural innovation and transmission of tool use in wild chimpanzees: evidence from field experiments (2003) Animal Cognition, 6, pp. 213-223; Bonner, J.T., (1980) The Evolution of Culture in Animals, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bonnie, K.E., de Waal, F.B.M., Copying without rewards: socially influenced foraging decisions among brown capuchin monkeys (2007) Animal Cognition, 10, pp. 283-292; Bonnie, K.E., Horner, V., Whiten, A., de Waal, F.B.M., Spread of arbitrary conventions among chimpanzees: a controlled experiment (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 367-372; Coussi-Korbel, S., Fragaszy, D.M., On the relation between social dynamics and social learning (1995) Animal behaviour, 50, pp. 1441-1453; Dindo, M., Thierry, B., Whiten, A., Social diffusion of novel foraging methods in brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 275, pp. 187-193; Dindo, M., Whiten, A., de Waal, F.M.B., In-group conformity sustains different foraging traditions in capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) (2009) PLoS ONE, 4, pp. e7858; Erwin, J., Aggression in captive macaques: interaction of social and spatial factors (1979) Captivity and Behavior, pp. 139-171. , Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, J.

The Chrysoperla carnea group of green lacewings has species-specific substrate-borne duetting songs that maintain reproductive isolation among its cryptic species. We propose that sympatric species of the group will partition acoustic niche space so as to minimize mating mistakes. Sibling species pairs could therefore occupy abutting regions of acoustic space without hybridizing in nature. One species pair, Chrysoperla plorabunda and C. adamsi, are not only closest relatives, but are also the most acoustically similar among sympatric congeners. Using F<sub>1</sub> hybrids as a surrogate taxon occupying acoustic space between the parents, we tested the hypothesis that this space cannot support an additional species. Focusing on a critical song feature, volley period, we confirm firstly that the hybrid song occupies unfilled signal space between the parents. Secondly, we show that song discrimination is strong between parents, but weaker between parents and hybrids. Thirdly, each parent has the ability to respond to the other's signal in a narrow region of overlap. Finally, preference functions for hybrids broadly overlap those of parents. These acoustic tests confirm that a species of this intermediate song phenotype could not persist. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acoustic space; Chrysopidae; Mating signal; Neuroptera; Preference function; Reproductive character displacement; Sexual conflict; Sexual selection; Speciation","bioacoustics; character displacement; crypsis; hybrid; hybridization; insect; niche partitioning; phenotype; reproductive isolation; sibling; signal; song; sympatry; Chrysoperla; Chrysoperla adamsi; Chrysoperla carnea; Chrysoperla plorabunda; Chrysopidae; Neuroptera",,,,,,"Arbuthnott, D., The genetic architecture of insect courtship behavior and premating isolation (2009) Heredity, 103, pp. 15-22; Bambach, R.K., Ecospace utilization and guilds in marine communities through the Phanerozoic (1983) Biotic Interactions in Recent and Fossil Benthic Communities, pp. 719-746. , Plenum, New York, M.J.S.

In cooperative vertebrates, this usually does not coincide with morphological differentiation. In species with indeterminate growth, however, size differences between subordinates may promote task specialization in the performance of helping behaviours, depending on size-specific capabilities, opportunities and cost/benefit ratios. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher, helpers perform different helping tasks. To examine the effects of helper size, which reflects age, on cooperative behaviour in the field, we experimentally presented egg predators that do not threaten helper survival. In the egg predator treatment, large and small helpers increased defence and all helpers roamed further from the breeding shelter, presumably to keep potential egg predators at a safe distance from the brood. Additionally, small helpers defended more against egg predators presented close to the breeding shelter than large helpers, whereas the latter put more effort into digging experimentally added sand out of the breeding shelter. Our results show size(age)-specific task specialization of helpers in a cooperatively breeding vertebrate, which is reminiscent of eusocial insects. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cichlidae; cooperative breeding; division of labour; egg predator; eusociality; helping behaviour; kin selection; Lake Tanganyika; Neolamprologus pulcher; pay to stay; spacing",,,,,,,,"Bruintjes, R.; Department of Behavioural Ecology, Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern, Switzerlaemail: rbruintjes@yahoo.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.10.004,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

This colour polymorphism is an area of growing interest in evolutionary biology as it contradicts many assumptions of natural and sexual selection. Owing to the strong role of colour in intraspecific communication, sexual selection is a primary candidate for balancing selection and its potential is supported by a growing body of both empirical and theoretical evidence. We examined patterns of mate choice in the ornate rainbowfish, Rhadinocentrus ornatus, a small freshwater fish species from the wallum habitat of east coast Australia, to see whether nonrandom mating contributes to colour polymorphism maintenance in this system. Populations from Fraser Island and the adjacent mainland comprise a common blue morph and a rare red morph. These colour morphs are present in both males and females, with red individuals accounting for approximately 18% of the individuals in our focal population from Fraser Island. In dichotomous laboratory mate choice experiments, we found that female R. ornatus preferred males of the opposite colour morph to themselves, a mating pattern known as negative assortative mating, which may provide indirect benefits to females through the generation of outbred offspring. In contrast, males preferred red females irrespective of their own colour morph, suggesting females may possess red morph-specific traits that are the target of sexual selection by males.

In fruit flies, where male-male courtship is prevalent, it has been suggested that young males gain from being courted by mature males, perhaps through learning. I conducted two series of experiments to critically examine why mature males court immature males and what immature males may gain from such courtship. The results indicate that mature males do not identify the sex of the sexually ambiguous immature males and find them attractive even after substantial experience. These findings agree with recent research indicating that males initially court a broad range of potential mating targets and then narrow their courtship focus based on their experience of being rejected by classes of flies such as recently mated females or heterospecific females, which are clearly identified by their distinct pheromonal profiles. Compared to inexperienced males, males that either had received courtship when immature or had been housed with mature males when young did not have either higher mating frequencies or shorter mating latencies but spent more time courting females. Such higher courtship intensities may translate into a mating advantage in some settings. It appears that young males that interact with mature males develop into a sexually aggressive phenotype, which could better prepare them to compete for females. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Courtship; Drosophila melanogaster; Fruit fly; Homosexual behaviour; Learning","behavioral ecology; courtship; fly; intrasexual interaction; learning; phenotype; pheromone; sexual behavior; sperm competition; Animalia; Drosophila melanogaster",,,,,,"Bailey, N.W., Zuk, M., Same-sex sexual behavior and evolution (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 439-446; Billeter, J.-C., Atallah, J., Krupp, J.J., Millar, J.G., Levine, J.D., Specialized cells tag sexual and species identity in Drosophila melanogaster (2009) Nature, 461, pp. 987-991; Bretman, A., Fricke, C., Hetherington, P., Stone, R., Chapman, T., Exposure to rivals and plastic responses to sperm competition in Drosophila melanogaster (2010) Behavioral Ecology, 21, pp. 317-321; Crumpacker, D.W., The use of micronized fluorescent dusts to mark adult Drosophila pseudoobscura (1974) American Midland Naturalist, 91, pp. 118-129; Curcillo, P.G., Tompkins, L., The ontogeny of sex appeal in Drosophila melanogaster males (1987) Behavior Genetics, 17, pp. 81-86; Dukas, R., Evolutionary biology of animal cognition (2004) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, 35, pp. 347-374; Dukas, R., Male fruit flies learn to avoid interspecific courtship (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 695-698; Dukas, R., Experience improves courtship in male fruit flies (2005) Animal Behaviour, 69, pp. 1203-1209; Dukas, R., Learning in the context of sexual behavior in insects (2006) Animal Biology, 56, pp. 125-141; Dukas, R., Dynamics of learning in the context of courtship in Drosophila persimilis and D. pseudoobscura (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 253-259; Dukas, R., Mooers, A.Ø., Environmental enrichment improves mating success in fruit flies (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 741-749; Dukas, R., Clark, C.W., Abbott, K., Courtship strategies of male insects: when is learning advantageous?

Several studies, however, suggest that animals tolerate inbreeding despite its costs. We studied inbreeding avoidance in bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, on Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada, a population with limited dispersal. We used a randomization procedure to simulate a mean inbreeding coefficient of lambs if mating was random every year, and compared these random mating scenarios with known pairings from 1996 to 2007. We considered three sets of candidate males: all males aged 2 years or more, only males known to reproduce, and all males but accounting for age differences in reproductive success. In all cases, mean cohort inbreeding coefficients did not differ from those expected under random mating. We found no evidence of avoidance of mating between close relatives (half-cousins and higher degrees of relatedness). Mate choice was possibly constrained by the generally high level of relatedness among individuals in the population. Selective pressures for inbreeding avoidance, however, may also be weak for this species because of sex-differential costs of inbreeding, limited opportunities of meeting close relatives and breeding migrations of males. The apparent lack of inbreeding avoidance has important implications for the conservation of small and isolated populations of bighorn sheep, where high levels of inbreeding should be expected. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Inbreeding; Inbreeding avoidance; Kin discrimination; Mate choice; Ovis canadensis; Relatedness; Selective pressures","dispersal; fitness; inbreeding avoidance; isolated population; kin recognition; mate choice; relatedness; reproductive cost; reproductive success; sexual selection; sheep; species conservation; Alberta; Canada; Ram Mountain; Animalia; Ovis aries; Ovis canadensis",,,,,,"Amundsen, T., Forsgren, E., Male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 98, pp. 13155-13160; Andersson, M.B., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Balmford, A., Albon, S., Blakeman, S., Correlates of male mating success and female choice in a lek-breeding antelope (1992) Behavioral Ecology, 3, pp. 112-123; Bengtsson, B.O., Avoiding inbreeding: at what cost?

It would also facilitate optimal inbreeding and outbreeding. Self-matching has been predicted for Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, yet previous work could not rule out the possibility that animals use family cues rather than or in addition to their own cues for recognition. After hibernation, U. beldingi recognize their littermates but not previously familiar nonkin. Kin templates, including cues of mother and littermates, may be maintained throughout life, or, they may be lost during hibernation with memories of unrelated individuals, in which case self-matching must be used to create a new template in the spring. Using a cross-fostering design, these two possibilities were tested with olfactory discrimination tests after ground squirrels aroused from hibernation. Yearlings recognized their siblings, but not fostermates they had been reared with since birth, demonstrating that kin templates are lost over winter and self-matching is used to recognize kin after hibernation. Results are discussed in terms of plasticity of kin recognition systems, the costs and benefits of maintaining social memories, and the contexts in which templates are updated. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Ground squirrel; Hibernation; Kin recognition; Nepotism; Olfactory discrimination; Self-referential phenotype matching","hibernation; inbreeding; kin recognition; memory; nepotism; olfactory cue; paternity; phenotypic plasticity; rodent; sibling; Animalia; Sciuridae; Spermophilus",,,,,,"Alberts, S.C., Paternal kin discrimination in wild baboons (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266, pp. 1501-1506; Bateson, P.P.G., Optimal outbreeding (1983) Mate Choice, pp. 257-277. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, P.P.G.

However, surrounding congeneric individuals may also accelerate food depletion. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify interference (contest) and exploitative (scramble) competition separately, particularly in the field. In an individual-based model, where food was immediately replenished in patches after a foraging bout, we isolated the effect of interference competition. In this way, we investigated how interference shapes the intake rates of flocking Bewick's swans, Cygnus bewickii, consuming tubers of fennel pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus. The model predicted that intake rate declines with increasing swan density, and that the rate of decline is greater in subordinate birds than in dominant birds. Subordinate birds suffered a large reduction in intake rate at high densities because they spent a large proportion of the time avoiding more dominant individuals. A major decline in intake rate of subordinates occurred close to the maximum swan densities observed in the field. We expected subordinates to leave high-density flocks and look for another foraging location: interference competition seemed to regulate the maximum swan flock density in the field. Hence, the mean population intake rate at realized densities was only slightly lower than in the absence of interference. As interference occurred mainly as avoidance behaviour, which is difficult to observe in the field, it might commonly remain cryptic for the observer. Our results may explain other field studies where interference competition seemed to be of lesser importance. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural state; Foraging efficiency; Ideal free distribution; Interference competition; Social foraging; Spatial distribution; Unequal competitors","crypsis; dominance; food consumption; food intake; food limitation; foraging behavior; ideal free distribution; individual-based model; interference competition; scramble competition; social behavior; spatial distribution; waterfowl; Aves; Cygnus; Cygnus bewickii; Foeniculum vulgare; Pectinatus; Potamogeton pectinatus",,,,,,"Alonso, J.C., Bautista, L.M., Alonso, J.A., Dominance and the dynamics of phenotype-limited distribution in common cranes (1997) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 40, pp. 401-408; Badzinski, S.S., Dominance relations and agonistic behaviour of tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) during fall and spring migration (2003) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 81, pp. 727-733; Barraquand, F., Benhamou, S., Animal movements in heterogeneous landscapes: identifying profitable places and homogeneous movement bouts (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 3336-3348; Bautista, L.M., Alonso, J.C., Alonso, J.A., A field test of ideal free distribution in flock-feeding common cranes (1995) Journal of Animal Ecology, 64, pp. 747-757; Beauchamp, G., On the use of public information by social foragers to assess patch quality (2004) Oikos, 107, pp. 206-209; Beauchamp, G., A spatial model of producing and scrounging (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1935-1942; Beekman, J.H., van Eerden, M.R., Dirksen, S., Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii utilising the changing resource of Potamogeton pectinatus during autumn in the Netherlands (1991) Wildfowl Supplement, 1, pp. 238-248; Black, J.M., Prop, J., Larsson, K., (2006) Wild Goose Dilemmas: Population Consequences of Individual Decisions in Barnacle Geese, , Branta Books, Groningen; Bonnie, K.E., Earley, R.L., Expanding the scope for social information use (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 171-181; Brockmann, H.J., Barnard, C.J., Kleptoparasitism in birds (1979) Animal Behaviour, 27, pp. 487-514; Charnov, E.L., Orians, G.H., Hyatt, K., Ecological implications of resource depression (1976) American Naturalist, 110, pp. 247-259; Cresswell, W., Interference competition at low competitor densities in blackbirds Turdus merula (1997) Journal of Animal Ecology, 66, pp. 461-471; Cresswell, W., Variation in the strength of interference competition with resource density in blackbirds, Turdus merula (1998) Oikos, 81, pp. 152-160; Dolman, P.M., The intensity of interference varies with resource density: evidence from a field study with snow buntings, Plectrophenax nivalis (1995) Oecologia, 102, pp. 511-514; Ens, B.J., Goss-Custard, J.D., Piping as a display of dominance by wintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus (1986) Ibis, 128, pp. 382-391; Fretwell, S.D., Lucas, H.L., On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds (1970) Acta Biotheoretica, 19, pp. 16-36; Goss-Custard, J.D., Competition for food and interference among waders (1980) Ardea, 68, pp. 31-52; Goss-Custard, J.D., Durell, S.E.A.L., Ens, B.J., Individual differences in aggressiveness and food stealing among wintering oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus L (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 917-928; Griffen, B.D., Consumers that are not 'ideal' or 'free' can still approach the ideal free distribution using simple patch-leaving rules (2009) Journal of Animal Ecology, 78, pp. 919-927; Gyimesi, A., van Rooij, E.P., Nolet, B.A., doi:10.1007/s00265-010-1001-5, In press.

We examined this issue in the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, as males of this species illustrate great flexibility in aggressive and territorial tactics in the field and in the laboratory. We found that the effects of both residency status and resource abundance (food, water and cover from predators) increased winning ability; however, there was no interaction between these two effects. As such, the impacts of residency and resource abundance on winning might represent two distinct behavioural phenomena that manifest via different mechanisms. We also found that mice that urine-marked an open arena at a high frequency were more likely to win fights in resource-rich environments compared to resource-poor environments. Meanwhile, mice that urine-marked the same type of environment at a substantially lower frequency did not show this behavioural difference between contexts. Because urinary marking behaviour is allied with aspects of risk-taking behaviour and social status, this result implies that males integrate information about their relative 'boldness' with information from their environment to make context-appropriate tactical decisions about fighting. We speculate that our data illustrate real-time, decision-making processes that are a necessary component of conditional strategies used to optimize fitness. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Bold-shy; Context dependent; Decision making; Mice; Peromyscus leucopus; Social behaviour; Social status; Territoriality; Winning behaviour","aggression; behavioral ecology; decision making; fighting; fitness; resource allocation; resource availability; rodent; territoriality; urine; Mus; Peromyscus; Peromyscus leucopus",,,,,,"Aragon, P., Lopez, P., Martin, J., Roles of male residence and relative size in the social behavior of Iberian rock lizards, Lacerta monticola (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59, pp. 762-769; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Fighting for shells: how private information about resource value changes hermit crab pre-fight displays and escalated fight behaviour (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 3011-3017; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Brain, P.F., Nowell, N.W., Some behavioral and endocrine relationships in adult male maboratory mice subjected to open field and aggression tests (1969) Physiology & Behavior, 4, pp. 945-947; Briffa, M., Sneddon, L.U., Physiological constraints on contest behaviour (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 627-637; Budaev, S.V., Zworykin, D.D., Mochek, A.D., Individual differences in parental care and behaviour profile in the convict cichlid: a correlation study (1999) Animal Behaviour, 58, pp. 195-202; Buena, L.J., Walker, S.E., Information asymmetry and aggressive behaviour in male house crickets, Acheta domesticus (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 199-204; Coleman, K., Wilson, D.S., Shyness and boldness in pumpkinseed sunfish: individual differences are context-specific (1998) Animal Behaviour, 56, pp. 927-936; Davies, N.B., Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Parage aegeria): the resident always wins (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 138-147; Desjardins, C., Maruniak, J.A., Bronson, F.H., Social rank in house mice: differentiation revealed by ultraviolet visualization of urinary marking patterns (1973) Science, 182, pp. 939-941; Eisenberg, J.F., Studies of the behavior of Peromyscus maniculatus gambelii and Peromyscus californicus parasiticus (1962) Behaviour, 19, pp. 177-207; Fayed, S.A., Jennion, M.D., Backwell, P.R.Y., What factors contribute to an ownership advantage?

Both fitness benefits and costs have been postulated for each condition; however, these remain to be demonstrated. Moreover, uncertainty remains about whether these ovarian cycle patterns are 'real' or an artefact of sampling and statistical design. We used a null model incorporating a bootstrap randomization procedure to examine whether ovarian cycles were more synchronous or asynchronous than expected by chance in a large captive hamadryas colony. Male contraception meant that all female colony members underwent repeated ovarian cycling throughout the 1-year study. No pairing or group of females had synchronous or asynchronous ovarian cycles. Rather, females oscillated between pseudosynchronous and pseudoasynchronous states, because ovarian cycle length varied between and within females. We outline why the absence of synchrony and asynchrony and variation in cycle length in this and other studies are explicable when one considers (1) the brief ovarian cycle bouts typical of natural fertility populations and (2) the type of synchrony or asynchrony measures that were employed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while variation in ovarian cycle length appears to be ubiquitous among animals with these cycles, this does not rule out the possibility of synchrony and asynchrony occurring in natural fertility populations. Further research on this phenomenon in hamadryas and other species is justified, therefore, albeit with a focus on natural fertility populations and employing null-model techniques similar to that used here. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alternative mating strategy; Exaggerated perineal swelling; Female reproduction; Hamadryas baboon; Mammal; Mate choice; Papio h. hamadryas; Primate; Secondary sexual trait","bootstrapping; captive population; fertility; fitness; mate choice; numerical model; primate; reproductive cost; reproductive cycle; reproductive strategy; secondary sexual characteristics; synchrony; Animalia; Hamadryas; Mammalia; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates",,,,,,"Arden, M.A., Dye, L., The assessment of menstrual synchrony: comment on Weller and Weller (1997) (1998) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 112, pp. 323-324; Asanov, S.S., Comparative features of the reproductive biology of hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (1972) Acta Endocrinologica Supplementum, 166, pp. 458-471; Caperton, L., Eddy, C., Leland, M.M., Carey, K.D., McCarrey, J.R., Alteration of the menstrual cycle in baboons placed on tethering devices and moved to individual housing: a stress model for a follicular phase defect (2006) Journal of Medical Primatology, 35, pp. 341-345; Colinshaw, G., Dunbar, R.I.M., Dominance rank and mating success in male primates (1991) Animal Behaviour, 41, pp. 1045-1056; Dixson, A.F., (1998) Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Eberhard, W.G., (1996) Female Control: Sexual Selection by Cryptic Female Choice, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Emlen, S.T., Oring, L.W., Ecology, sexual selection, and the evolution of mating systems (1977) Science, 197, pp. 215-223; French, J.A., Stribley, J.A., Synchronization of ovarian cycles within and between social groups in golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) (1987) American Journal of Primatology, 12, pp. 469-478; Gattermann, R., Ulbrich, K., Weinandy, R., Asynchrony in the estrous cycles of golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) (2002) Hormones and Behavior, 42, pp. 70-77; Harlow, S.D., Matanoski, G.M., The association between weight, physical activity, and stress and variation in the length of the menstrual cycle (1991) American Journal of Epidemiology, 133, pp. 38-49; Hausfater, G., Dominance and reproduction in baboons (Papio cynocephalus): quantitative analysis (1975) Contributions to Primatology, 7, pp. 2-150; Hendrickx, A.G., Kraemer, D.C., Observations on the menstrual cycle, optimal mating time and pre-implantation embryos of the baboon, Papio anubis and Papio cynocephalus (1969) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, Supplement, 6, pp. 119-128; Holm, S., A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure (1979) Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 6, pp. 65-70; Hrdy, S.B., The optimal number of fathers: evolution, demography, and history in the shaping of female mate preferences (2000) Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 907, pp. 75-96; Henry, L., Some data on natural fertility (1961) Eugenics Quarterly, 8, pp. 81-91; Ims, R.A., The ecology and evolution of reproductive synchrony (1990) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 5, pp. 135-140; Jarett, L.R., Psychosocial and biological influences on menstruation: synchrony, cycle length, and regularity (1984) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 9, pp. 21-28; Jolly, C.J., Phillips-Conroy, J.E., Testicular size, mating system, and maturation schedules in wild anubis and hamadryas baboons (2003) International Journal of Primatology, 24, pp. 125-142; Jolly, C.J., Phillips-Conroy, J.E., Testicular size, developmental trajectories, and male life history strategies in four baboon taxa (2006) Reproduction and Fitness in Baboons: Behavioral, Ecological, and Life History Perspectives, pp. 257-275. , Springer, New York, L.

Animals may assort by a variety of characteristics and receive substantial benefits from these interactions, such as a reduction in predation risk, increased foraging efficiency or greater access to resources. We investigated the social network structure of an embayment population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, using a long-term photoidentification data set, and examined the impact of sex and kinship in maintaining the cohesion of the social network. We applied recently developed social network techniques that incorporate uncertainty into statistical measures to delineate four smaller social groups within two previously defined communities. Temporal stability of associations within social groups was substantially greater than among individuals from different groups. We also found that the dolphin population was not strongly segregated by sex and both males and females had similar degrees of social connectivity in the network. Moreover, genetic analyses showed that relatedness had a greater influence on female than on male social relationships, as association strength was positively correlated with genetic relatedness between females and between female and male pairs, but not between males. These results suggest that females and males may target kin interactions with females and that kinship appears to be important for maintaining the cohesiveness of this dolphin social network. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Association; Bottlenose dolphin; Relatedness; Social network; Tursiops aduncus","age class; conspecific; data set; dolphin; female; genetic analysis; kinship; photograph; relatedness; social network; uncertainty analysis; Animalia; Tursiops; Tursiops aduncus",,,,,,"Amos, W., Hoelzel, A.R., Long-term preservation of whale skin for DNA analysis (1991) Reports of the International Whaling Commission, Special Issue, 13, pp. 99-104; Amos, W., Schlotterer, C., Tautz, D., Social structure of pilot whales revealed by analytical DNA profiling (1993) Science, 260, pp. 670-672; Archie, E.A., Moss, C.J., Alberts, S.C., The ties that bind: genetic relatedness predicts the fission and fusion of social groups in wild African elephants (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 513-522; Armitage, K.B., Schwartz, O.A., Social enhancement of fitness in yellow-bellied marmots (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 97, pp. 12149-12152; Asendorpf, J.B., Wilpers, S., Personality effects on social relationships (1998) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, pp. 1531-1544; Baird, R.W., Dill, L.M., The killer-whale-foraging specializations and group hunting (2000) Cetacean Societies: Field Studies of Dolphins and Whales, pp. 127-153. , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, J.

We analysed sleep behaviour in a free-living population of blue tits in southern Germany. We recorded individuals roosting in nestboxes between November and April using infrared-sensitive cameras. We investigated the following sleep parameters: time of entering and leaving the nestbox, sleep onset, awakening time, sleep duration, midpoint of sleep, latency to sleep and frequency and duration of nocturnal awakenings. Sleep onset, awakening time and sleep duration followed seasonal changes in daylength. Blue tits slept ca 4.8 h longer in winter than in spring. During the night, birds woke up between 23 and 230 times, but this did not change seasonally. Local light conditions influenced awakening time: birds at brighter locations woke up earlier. Females slept on average 15 min longer per night than males and this sex difference became more pronounced in early spring. Although females spent a greater proportion of the night awake than males, they still slept more overall. First-year birds spent more time in the nestbox after waking up and left the nestbox later in the morning than older individuals. Repeatability estimates showed that individuals were consistent in their sleep behaviour over the 2-year study period. Our results indicate that sleep patterns are individual-specific traits in blue tits.

In this study, we focused on a major gap in the understanding of this striking behaviour: the question of the sensory modality by which meaningful information is transferred from dancers to followers. We revisited the hypothesis that tactile stimuli convey information about the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase. It has long been suggested that followers use tactile stimuli arising from the wagging movements of a dancing bee to decode information in the dance. Yet, the questions of whether and to what extent such movements are mapped to the tactile experience of the followers have never been resolved. Using high-speed video techniques, we found that the higher the number of the dancer's wagging movements, the higher the number of the followers' antennal deflections. We also documented that most followers faced the dancers laterally and experienced a fairly regular pattern of tactile stimuli; a much smaller proportion of followers faced the dancers from behind and became the subject of a different, although still regular, pattern of tactile stimuli. From these observations, we conclude that tactile mechanosensory input from the antennae, presumably processed by neurons of the antennal joint hair sensilla and the neck hair plates, enables bees to estimate both the direction relative to gravity and the length of the waggle phase. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera; Dance communication; Honeybee; Mechanosensory input; Tactile stimulus; Waggle dance","behavioral ecology; communication behavior; gravity; hair; honeybee; hypothesis testing; movement; sensory system; videography; Animalia; Apis mellifera; Apoidea",,,,,,"Božič, J., Abramson, C.I., Following and attending: two distinct behavior patterns of honeybees in a position to collect the dance information (2003) Mellifera, 3, pp. 48-55; Božič, J., Valentinčič, T., Attendants and followers of honeybee waggle dances (1991) Journal of Apiculture Research, 30, pp. 125-131; Brockmann, A., Robinson, G.E., Central projections of sensory systems involved in honey bee dance language communication (2007) Brain, Behavior and Evolution, 70, pp. 125-136; De Marco, R.J., Menzel, R., Encoding spatial information in the waggle dance (2005) Journal of Experimental Biology, 208, pp. 3885-3894; De Marco, R.J., Gurevitz, J.M., Menzel, R., Variability in the encoding of spatial information by dancing bees (2008) Journal of Experimental Biology, 211, pp. 1635-1644; Dreller, C., Kirchner, W.H., Hearing in honeybees: localization of the auditory sense organ (1993) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 173, pp. 275-279; von Frisch, K., Die Tänze der Bienen (1946) Österreichische Zoologische Zeitschrift, 1, pp. 1-48; von Frisch, K., (1967) The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Johnston, C.H.R., Auditory apparatus of the Culex mosquito (1855) Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, 3, pp. 97-102; Judd, T.M., The waggle dance of the honey bee: which bees following a dancer successfully acquire the information?

Some researchers have claimed that this only occurs when food is not involved and the recipient actively solicits help. In the current study, however, we found that chimpanzees often helped conspecifics obtain food in a pulling task with no solicitation whatsoever, in a situation in which, based on past experience, the conspecific's desire for the food was apparent. We also assessed whether the collaborative context of the situation impacted helping rates. Specifically, we compared how often both partners obtained rewards when one partner needed the help of the other, who had already received a reward for free (helping without collaboration), and when one partner needed the other's help after they had already begun collaborating (helping during collaboration). Partners provided assistance significantly more often in both of these helping conditions than in a control condition in which partners could provide unneeded help. However, unlike human children who have been tested in a similar task, chimpanzees did not help their partner more during (than without) collaboration. These results suggest that chimpanzees' helping behaviour is more robust than previously believed, but at the same time may have different evolutionary roots from the helping behaviour of humans. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Altruism; Chimpanzee; Cooperation; Pan troglodytes; Solicitation","altruism; conspecific; eusociality; evolutionary biology; food intake; hominid; primate; Pan; Pan troglodytes",,,,,,"Boesch, C., Joint cooperative hunting among wild chimpanzees: taking natural observations seriously (2005) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28, pp. 692-693; Burkart, J.M., Fehr, E., Efferson, C., van Schaik, C.P., Other-regarding preferences in a non-human primate: common marmosets provision food altruistically (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 104, pp. 19762-19766; Burkart, J.M., Hrdy, S.B., van Schaik, C.P., Cooperative breeding and human cognitive evolution (2009) Evolutionary Anthropology, 18, pp. 175-186; Cronin, K.A., Schroeder, K.K.E., Rothwell, E.S., Silk, J.B., Snowdon, C.T., Cooperatively breeding cottontop tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) do not donate rewards to their long-term mates (2009) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 123, pp. 231-241; Dugatkin, L.A., (1997) Cooperation Among Animals, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Dugatkin, L.A., (2006) The Altruism Equation, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Gräfenhain, M., Behne, T., Carpenter, M., Tomasello, M., Young children's understanding of joint commitments (2009) Developmental Psychology, 45, pp. 1430-1443; Graw, B., Manser, M.B., The function of mobbing in cooperative meerkats (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 507-517; Hemelrijk, C.K., Klomberg, T.J.M., Nooitgedagt, J.H., van Hooff, J.A.R.A.M., Side-directed behaviour and recruitment of support in captive chimpanzees (1991) Behaviour, 118, pp. 89-102; Jensen, K., Hare, B., Call, J., Tomasello, M., What's in it for me?

Studies generally report consistent individual differences in activity level in the open-field, but no study has tested whether individuals change their activity level differently within a single open-field test. If such differences exist, then the reliability of activity levels measured over the whole test may be affected by the duration of the test. Here, we present analyses showing how a reaction norm approach can be used to account for individual differences in temporal activity patterns. Specifically, we measured individual temporal patterns of activity in wild eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, and house mouse, Mus musculus, strains by decomposing the total duration of open-field tests into successive shorter time intervals. Open-field tests on chipmunks and mice lasted 3 min and 5 min, respectively. We detected repeatable individual and strain differences in temporal activity patterns. Activity during the first time interval (at the beginning of the test) was positively correlated with activity measured over the whole test, meaning that short tests yield a valid measure of activity in chipmunks and mice. We recommend analysing open-field data using random regressions to obtain activity measurements that are robust against differences in temporal activity patterns. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Activity; Exploration; Open-field test; Personality; Rodent","activity pattern; behavioral ecology; field method; individual variation; regression analysis; rodent; temporal variation; testing method; wild population; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus; Rodentia; Tamias striatus",,,,,,"Archer, J., Tests for emotionality in rats and mice: a review (1973) Animal Behaviour, 21, pp. 205-235; Bell, A.M., Behavioural differences between individuals and two populations of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 464-473; Bell, A.M., Travis, M.P., Hybridization, transgressive segregation, genetic covariation, and adaptive radiation (2005) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 20, pp. 358-361; Benus, R.F., Bohus, B., Koolhaas, J.M., van Oortmerssen, G.A., Behavioral strategies of aggressive and non-aggressive mice in active shock avoidance (1989) Behavioural Processes, 20, pp. 1-12; Biro, P.A., Dingemanse, N.J., Sampling bias resulting from animal personality (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 66-67; Bogue, M.A., Grubb, S.C., Maddatu, T.P., Bult, C.J., Mouse Phenome Database (MPD) (2007) Nucleic Acids Research, 35, pp. D643-D649; Boon, A.K., Réale, D., Boutin, S., The interaction between personality, offspring fitness and food abundance in North American red squirrels (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 1094-1104; Campbell, T., Lin, S., DeVries, C., Lambert, K., Coping strategies in male and female rats exposed to multiple stressors (2003) Physiology and Behavior, 78, pp. 495-504; Carere, C., Drent, P.J., Privitera, L., Koolhaas, J.M., Groothuis, T.G.G., Personalities in great tits, Parus major: stability and consistency (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 795-805; Choleris, E., Thomas, A.W., Kavaliers, M., Prato, F.S., A detailed ethological analysis of the mouse open field test: effects of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide and aan extremely low frequency pulsed magnetic field (2001) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 25, pp. 235-260; Corey, D.T., The determinants of exploration and neophobia (1978) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 2, pp. 235-253; Crawley, M.J., (2005) Statistics, an Introduction Using R, , J.

Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that nest predation is an important ecological factor affecting the occurrence and evolution of CBP; however, behavioural responses of parasites to nest predation remain unexplored. Here we report on a field experiment addressing the ability of parasitically laying common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, females to respond to nest predation, based either on their own experience or on public information. Females that started parasitic laying in a nest and afterwards experienced partial clutch predation stopped laying in the nest. However, nests that faced partial clutch predation earlier in the season were not avoided by other parasitically laying females later in the season; these later-laying females had not themselves experienced the partial clutch predation in the nest. Hence, considering within-season responses to nest predation, a parasite uses its own experience, rather than public information, in laying decisions and nest choice. The rate of parasitic laying in the experimental nests decreased from the first to the last year of the experiment. Because the experimental nests never produced a successful clutch, this finding suggests that parasites used information on the ever-failing nature of the nests and avoided laying in them. Our results offer new experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that safety and success of nest sites play important roles in CBP. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bucephala clangula; Common goldeneye; Conspecific brood parasitism; Information reliability; Nest predation; Personal information; Protein fingerprinting; Public information","behavioral response; brood parasitism; decision making; evolutionary biology; experimental study; hypothesis testing; life history; nest predation; nest site; protein; waterfowl; Aves; Bucephala; Bucephala clangula",,,,,,"Åhlund, M., Behavioural tactics at nest visits differ between parasites and hosts in a brood-parasitic duck (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 433-440; Åhlund, M., Andersson, M., Female ducks can double their reproduction (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 600-601; Andersson, M., Åhlund, M., Protein fingerprinting: a new technique reveals extensive conspecific brood parasitism (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 1433-1442; Arnold, K.E., Owens, I.P.F., Extra-pair paternity and egg dumping in birds: life history, parental care and the risk of retaliation (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 1263-1269; Danchin É, Heg, D., Doligez, B., Public information and breeding habitat selection (2001) Dispersal, pp. 243-258. , Oxford University Press, New York, J.

Roaring alarm utterances generally consist of the same basic call types but differ in overall structural composition. Leopards trigger roaring alarms containing many roaring sequences of only a few calls each, while eagles trigger few sequences with many calls each. To investigate whether conspecifics extract meaning from these structural differences, we played back leopard and eagle alarm call sequences and compared the monkeys' responses in terms of their locomotor, gaze and vocal behaviour with their responses to the corresponding predator vocalizations. Locomotor responses did not differ between playback conditions; movement was always towards the simulated caller with no clear patterns in the vertical plane. Gaze direction, however, was highly predator specific. When hearing leopard-related stimuli, monkeys were significantly more likely to scan the area beneath them than when hearing eagle-related stimuli, which caused more scanning above. Vocal response rates to conspecific alarms were generally low but comparable with rates to the corresponding predators. If monkeys called, however, they produced the matching call sequences. Overall, our results showed that Guerezas discriminated between predator alarm call sequences produced by unfamiliar conspecifics and responded to them in predator-specific ways. Since the sequences were composed of the same basic call types, we concluded that the monkeys attended to the compositional aspects of these utterances. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alarm call; Budongo Forest; Colobus guereza; Guereza colobus; Perception advertisement; Predation; Predator deterrence; Primate communication; Semantic; Syntax","alarm signal; bioacoustics; calling behavior; conspecific; felid; locomotion; predation; primate; raptor; vocalization; Budongo Forest; Uganda; Western Province [Uganda]; Accipitridae; Colobinae; Colobus; Colobus guereza; Colobus sp.; Felidae; Panthera; Panthera pardus; Primates; Stephanoaetus coronatus",,,,,,"Arnold, K., Zuberbühler, K., Language evolution: semantic combinations in primate calls (2006) Nature, 441, p. 303; Arnold, K., Zuberbühler, K., Meaningful call combinations in a non-human primate (2008) Current Biology, 18, pp. R202-R203; Blumstein, D.T., Golden-marmot alarm calls. 2.

Ritualized displays reduce risk and energy expenditure during assessments, but may lead to injurious fighting behaviour under certain circumstances. In this study, we examined the decision-making process of male sierra dome spiders (Neriene (= Linyphia) litigiosa: Linyphiidae) during 323 male-male contests using multivariate analysis. In contests over females, male ritualized displays include distinct phases by which males facultatively escalate fights: ritualized noncontact display, pedipalp wrestling, and unritualized biting and grappling. Amongst these phases we found evidence for all three types of assessment. Self-assessment was indicated by effects of the lighter male's mass and the metabolic effect of temperature. These factors influenced the duration of noncontact display, likelihood of escalation and energetic expenditures. Opponent assessment, indicated by the effects of the difference in mass between contestants, influenced all aspects of fight behaviour when differences in body mass were large. When differences in body mass were small, relative mass only affected the duration of the fight, primarily by lengthening noncontact display. Resource assessment, measured through effects of female reproductive value and the males' future reproductive opportunities, primarily influenced the decision to escalate to unritualized combat and the duration of the unritualized combat. Our multivariate analysis of behaviourally distinct phases of contests showed that contestants use diverse information to adjust investment in displays and potentially injurious fighting. We discuss the roles of information transfer versus raw attempts to influence outcomes in this complex contest system. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Assessment; Communication; Contest; Display fight; Male-male competition; Resource-holding potential; Signalling; Spider","behavioral ecology; bioenergy; body mass; contest competition; decision making; display behavior; fighting; injury; multivariate analysis; reproductive cost; resource allocation; signaling; sperm competition; spider; Araneae; Linyphia; Linyphiidae; Neriene; Neriene litigiosa",,,,,,"Ancona, S., Drummond, H., Zaldívar-Rae, J., Male whiptail lizards adjust energetically costly mate guarding to male-male competition and female reproductive value (2010) Animal Behaviour, 79, pp. 75-82; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Information gathering and decision making about resource value in animal contests (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 529-542; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Bergman, D.A., Moore, P.A., Field observations of intraspecific agonistic behavior of two crayfish species, Orconectes rusticus and Orconectes virilis, in different habitats (2003) Biological Bulletin, 205, pp. 26-35; Briffa, M., Elwood, R.W., Difficulties remain in distinguishing between mutual and self-assessment in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 759-762; Briffa, M., Sneddon, L.U., Physiological constraints on contest behaviour (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 627-637; Briffa, M., Sneddon, L.U., Contest behavior (2010) Evolutionary Behavioral Ecology, pp. 246-265. , Oxford University Press, New York, D.F.

Since females often acquire all the sperm they need in one mating and since mating is usually costly, the evolution of polyandry is puzzling. Females may gain from mating multiply by ensuring fertilization, increasing offspring diversity, improving mate quality ('good genes') or increasing genetic compatibility. Alternatively, multiple mating may result in a net cost to females as a by-product of male-male competition. We report on field experiments in which we evaluated whether spawning with multiple males is costly or beneficial for female horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus. Unpaired male horseshoe crabs crowd around some spawning pairs (polyandrous) as satellites while ignoring others (monandrous). We conducted three field experiments in which we compared the success of (1) unmanipulated polyandrous and monandrous females, (2) polyandrous females with and without satellites (satellites removed) and (3) monandrous females without and with satellites (forced to be polyandrous by adding satellites). When polyandrous females lost their satellite males, they laid more eggs than did polyandrous females that retained their satellites. When a satellite male arrives at a monandrous pair, some females are tolerant and will nest as a polyandrous female, but many females are intolerant of satellite males and leave immediately, thus laying fewer eggs. These results indicate that spawning with multiple males is costly in terms of nesting success for female horseshoe crabs. Yet, natural monandrous and polyandrous females did equally well, suggesting that there are compensating benefits from multiple males for polyandrous females. We suggest that monandry and polyandry may be alternative reproductive tactics for female horseshoe crabs. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alternative reproductive tactic; Limulus polyphemus; Mate choice; Polyandry; Sexual harassment; Sperm competition","crab; cytoplasmic incompatibility; experimental study; good genes hypothesis; mate choice; nesting success; polyandry; reproductive cost; reproductive strategy; spawning; sperm competition; Limulus; Limulus polyphemus; Merostomata",,,,,,"Alcock, J., Eickwort, G.C., Eickwort, K.R., The reproductive behavior of Anthidium maculosum (Hymenoptera megachilidae) and the evolutionary significance of multiple copulations by females (1977) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 2, pp. 385-396; Arnqvist, G., The evolution of animal genitalia: distinguishing between hypotheses by single species studies (1997) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 60, pp. 365-379; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 145-164; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Barber, S.B., Itzkowitz, M., Crowding effects on hatching of Limulus embryos (1982) American Zoologist, 22, p. 879; Birkhead, T.R., Møller, A.P., (1998) Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection, , Academic Press, New York; Bishop, J.D.D., Manriquez, P.H., Hughes, R.N., Water-borne sperm trigger vitellogenic egg growth in two sessile marine invertebrates (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 267, pp. 1165-1169; Botton, M.L., Loveland, R.E., Body size, morphological constraints, and mated pair formation in four populations of horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) along a geographic cline (1992) Marine Biology, 112, pp. 409-415; Botton, M.L., Shuster, C.N., Keinath, J.A., Horseshoe crabs in a food web: who eats whom?

In ants and other social insects, social recognition relies on multicomponent chemical signatures, composed primarily of long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons. These signatures are colony specific and allow discrimination between nestmates and non-nestmates. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying detection, perception and information processing of chemical signatures are poorly understood. It has been suggested that associative learning might play a role in nestmate recognition. We investigated whether Camponotus aethiops ants can associate a complete cuticular hydrocarbon profile, consisting of about 40 compounds, with a food reward and whether the new association, developed in an appetitive context, affects aggression against non-nestmates carrying the hydrocarbon profile associated with food. Individual ant workers were able to associate the non-nestmate chemical profile with food. However, conditioned ants were still aggressive when encountering a non-nestmate carrying the odour profile used as training odour in our experiments. This suggests that ants, like some, but not all other insects, show interactions between different modalities (i.e. olfactory and visual), and can treat complex chemical cues differently, according to the context in which they are perceived. This plasticity ensures that learning in an appetitive context does not interfere with the crucial task of colony defence. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Ant; Associative learning; Camponotus aethiops; Conditioning; Context; Cuticular hydrocarbon; Perception; Recognition","aggression; ant; chemical cue; colony; conditioning; cuticle; food availability; hydrocarbon; nestmate recognition; olfactory cue; perception; social insect; worker caste; Animalia; Camponotus aethiops; Formicidae; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Balderrama, J., Núñez, J., Guerrieri, F.J., Giurfa, M., Different functions of two alarm substances in the honeybee (2002) Journal of Comparative Physiology A: Neuroethology, Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology, 188, pp. 485-491; Bitterman, M.E., Menzel, R., Fietz, A., Schafer, S., Classical conditioning of proboscis extension in honeybees (Apis mellifera) (1983) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 97, pp. 107-119; Bonavita-Cougourdan, A., Clément, J.L., Lange, C., Nestmate recognition: the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in the ant Camponotus vagus Scop (1987) Journal of Entomological Science, 22, pp. 1-10; Breed, M.D., Pheromones of the honey bee (1998) BioScience, 48, pp. 463-470; de Brito-Sánchez, M.G., Deisig, N., Sandoz, J.C., Giurfa, M., Neurobiology of olfactory communication in a social insect: the honeybee (2008) Sociobiology of Communication: an Interdisciplinary Perspective, pp. 119-138. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, P. d'Ettorre, D.P.

In songbirds, the predictive content of most putatively aggressive vocal signals remains largely unresolved. Prior studies of agonistic vocal signalling in birds have generally assessed the reliability of vocal displays using indirect response measures such as approach to a playback speaker. However, this method does not allow aggression to be assessed directly, because subjects have no opportunity to engage in actual attacks. In this study, we assessed the aggressive content of vocal signals in black-throated blue warblers, Dendroica caerulescens, using a direct measure of aggression. We presented territorial males with a brief period of conspecific song playback, recorded their vocal responses, and then revealed a taxidermic mount, giving subjects an opportunity to attack. We found that one song feature, low-amplitude 'soft' song, was an extremely reliable predictor of attack; a logistic regression model in which the occurrence of soft song was the sole predictor correctly classified 93% of males as attackers or nonattackers. By contrast, four other vocal behaviours (total number of songs, rate of song type switching and numbers of two nonsong vocalizations) failed to predict whether birds would attack the mount. These data provide evidence that soft song in black-throated blue warblers conveys extremely reliable information about impending aggression. We suggest that the reliability of soft song observed in this study and recent studies in emberizid sparrows may be stabilized by vulnerability costs because the limited distance with which it can be transmitted forces signallers to place themselves at risk of retaliatory attack. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggressive signalling; Birdsong; Black-throated blue warbler; Dendroica caerulescens; Reliability; Soft song","aggression; bioacoustics; regression analysis; reliability analysis; signal; song; songbird; Animalia; Aves; Dendroica caerulescens; Emberizinae; Passeri; Passeridae; Phylloscopus sibilatrix",,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Mesterton-Gibbons, M., The cost of threat displays and the stability of deceptive communication (1995) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 175, pp. 405-421; Anderson, R.C., Searcy, W.A., Peters, S., Nowicki, S., Soft song in song sparrows: acoustic structure and implications for signal function (2008) Ethology, 114, pp. 662-676; Andersson, M., Social behaviour and communication in the great skua (1976) Behaviour, 58, pp. 40-77; Ballentine, B., Searcy, W.A., Nowicki, S., Reliable aggressive signalling in swamp sparrows (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 693-703; Beecher, M.D., Campbell, S.E., Burt, J.M., Hill, C.E., Nordby, J.C., Song-type matching between neighbouring song sparrows (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 21-27; Beeman, K., (2002) Signal 4.0, , Engineering Design, Belmont, Massachusetts; Burmeister, S.S., Ophir, A.G., Ryan, M.J., Wilczynski, W., Information transfer during cricket frog interactions (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 715-725; Collins, S., Vocal fighting and flirting: the functions of birdsong (2004) Nature's Music: the Science of Birdsong, pp. 33-79. , Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego, P.

To investigate the stress sensitivity of yawning in birds, we exposed budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to a handling stressor that simulated a predatory encounter. Each bird was captured, gently held for 4. min, and then released and videotaped for 1. h (experimental). On a separate day (±24. h), the undisturbed animal was videotaped for 1. h (control). The relationship between handling-induced yawning and body temperature was assessed in a separate experiment, in which the underwing temperatures of the same birds were measured at 1. min intervals during a 4. min holding period. After handling stress, yawning frequency was initially suppressed, then sharply increased within 20. min. Underwing temperature increased during handling, and individuals' final temperatures at minute 4 were negatively correlated with their latencies to yawn after handling. Thus, stress-induced hyperthermia may be responsible for associations between yawns and stress. These results indicate that yawning may offer a sensitive, noninvasive measure of stress in birds. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Antipredator response; Budgerigar; Handling; Stress; Thermoregulation; Yawning","antipredator defense; bird; body temperature; encounter rate; experimental study; handling stress; inhibition; predator-prey interaction; prey capture; thermoregulation; videography; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Melopsittacus; Melopsittacus undulatus; Psittacidae",,,,,,"Baenninger, R., Some comparative aspects of yawning in Betta splendens, Homo sapiens, Panthera leo, and Papio sphinx (1987) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 101, pp. 349-354; Baenninger, R., On yawning and its functions (1997) Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 4, pp. 198-207; Cabanac, A.J., Guillemette, M., Temperature and heart rate as stress indicators of handled common eider (2001) Physiology & Behavior, 74, pp. 475-479; Carere, C., van Oers, K., Shy and bold great tits (Parus major): body temperature and breath rate in response to handling stress (2004) Physiology & Behavior, 82, pp. 905-912; Deputte, B.L., Ethological study of yawning in primates. 1.

Nevertheless, coalitions of unrelated males are widespread across mammals. Recently, a mathematical model for the evolution of male coalitions within groups was developed, predicting patterns and outcomes of coalitions depending on the degree of contest competition for mates. We tested this model in a species with presumably low-contest competition. Accordingly, under low contest, coalitions should be large, formed by mid- to low-ranking males targeting top-rankers and aimed at decreasing reproductive skew (all-up levelling coalitions). We also investigated the effect of scramble competition on coalitions, as its impact was not included in the model. Scramble competition is expected to be pronounced in our study population of Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, and thus we predicted that coalitions should target mainly young immigrants, irrespective of rank, to isolate them and eventually reduce male group size and, consequently, scramble competition. Data on social interactions, including coalitions, were collected on 23 males of a group of Barbary macaques living at Affenberg Salem, Germany. Coalition size was small, coalitions rarely targeted top-ranking males and all-up levelling coalitions were rare. Overall, the model was not confirmed. In contrast, more than three-quarters of coalitions targeted young immigrants, which were isolated from the group. Thus, male coalition formation in our group seemed to be influenced by scramble rather than contest competition. Both modes of competition should thus be taken into account if payoffs of coalition formation are investigated. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Affenberg Salem; Barbary macaque; Contest competition; Macaca sylvanus; Male coalition; Scramble competition","contest competition; group size; intrasexual interaction; isolated population; male; model test; numerical model; primate; resource availability; scramble competition; sperm competition; Germany; Macaca; Macaca sylvanus; Mammalia",,,,,,"Alberts, S., Watts, H., Altmann, J., Queuing and queue-jumping: long-term patterns of reproductive skew in male savannah baboons, Papio cynocephalus (2003) Animal Behaviour, 65, pp. 821-840; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Altmann, S.A., A field study of the sociobiology of the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta (1962) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 102, pp. 338-435; Berman, C.M., Ionica, C., Li, J., Supportive and tolerant relationships among male Tibetan macaques at Huangshan, China (2007) Behaviour, 144, pp. 631-661; Birkhead, T.R., Møller, A.P., (1998) Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection, , Academic Press, London; Bissonnette, A., (2009), Testing a model on coalitions in Barbary macaque males (Macaca sylvanus).

The sensory channel(s) used for recognition has also been much discussed. In aquatic invertebrates, vision has been one of the least understood media. We carried out two laboratory experiments using 49 pairs of adult male American lobsters. The first experiment was aimed at investigating the sensory channel/s (smell, sight or the two combined) used by lobsters to get information about the opponent, whereas in the second experiment we tested whether visual experience might allow lobsters to recognize the familiar opponent. Previous exposure to the sight of a conspecific induced lobsters either to avoid the opponent or to skip preliminaries (approaches and threats) and escalate the interaction. However, such changes in the dynamics of fighting were shown only when the opponent was the individual that the experimental lobster had previously seen rather than a generic lobster. This is the first study to provide evidence that lobsters can identify familiar conspecifics by sight, although this does not necessarily mean that they recognize them as individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggressive behaviour; Homarus americanus; Individual recognition; Lobster; Sight","adult; aggression; conspecific; experimental study; lobster; male; recognition; vision; visual cue; Homarus americanus; Invertebrata; lobster",,,,,,"Ameyaw-Akumfi, C., Hazlett, B.A., Sex recognition in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii (1975) Science, 190, pp. 1225-1226; Aquiloni, L., Gherardi, F., Crayfish females eavesdrop on fighting males and use smell and sight to recognize the identity of the winner (2010) Animal Behaviour, 79, pp. 265-269; Aquiloni, L., Buřič, M., Gherardi, F., Crayfish females eavesdrop on fighting males before choosing the dominant mate (2008) Current Biology, 18, pp. 462-463; Aquiloni, L., Massolo, A., Gherardi, F., Sex identification in female crayfish is bimodal (2009) Naturwissenschaften, 96, pp. 103-110; Atema, J., Review of sexual selection and chemical communication in the lobster, Homarus americanus (1986) Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 43, pp. 2283-2290; Atema, J., Cobb, J.S., Social behavior (1980) The Biology and Management of Lobsters.

Herbivorous insects may adopt different strategies for spreading their eggs (e.g. single oviposition events versus egg clustering). Host plant use results from the interplay of available cues and the responsiveness of the ovipositing female. We studied how egg-laying behaviour of individual females resulted in the egg distribution patterns observed at the population level in the ant-parasitic butterfly Maculinea alcon. Eggs are laid on marsh gentians, Gentiana pneumonanthe, but survival also depends on the presence of Myrmica host ants as young caterpillars leave the host plant and survive only after being adopted by ants. Several studies have focused on egg distribution patterns, but less so on the behavioural mechanisms behind the oviposition patterns. Our observational data show evidence for some level of egg clustering, as predicted by the obligate myrmecophilous lifestyle. There was no evidence of egg-laying avoidance when gentians already carried several eggs. Phenological time windows for oviposition on individual flower buds and gentians were much wider than reported before. Detailed tracking of egg-laying females in the field showed high rates of oviposition and suggest relatively high average levels of fecundity compared to fully herbivorous lycaenid butterflies. Results are discussed in relation to adaptive oviposition strategies of this highly specialist ant parasite of conservation concern. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Butterfly; Fecundity; Host plant selection; Maculinea alcon; Myrmecophily; Oviposition","adaptation; ant; bud; butterfly; caterpillar; egg; fecundity; herb; herbivore; host plant; host selection; individual variation; life history trait; marsh; myrmecophily; oviposition; parental care; phenology; site selection; specialist; survival; Formicidae; Gentiana; Gentiana pneumonanthe; Hexapoda; Lycaenidae; Maculinea alcon; Myrmica; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Akino, T., Knapp, J.J., Thomas, J.A., Elmes, G.W., Chemical mimicry and host specificity in the butterfly Maculinea rebeli, a social parasite of Myrmica ant colonies (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266, pp. 1419-1426; Alonso, C., Choosing a place to grow.

As social insects are usually aggressive towards intruders, social parasites have to circumvent the host's nestmate recognition system to enter the host colony successfully. Many studies on paper wasps have shown that, after host nest invasion, Polistes social parasites change their chemical profile to match the host's odour, thus allowing their acceptance into its colony. However, a social parasite's usurpation strategy may benefit from signals that reduce or eliminate the aggression of the host. We used lure presentation experiments to investigate whether Polistes sulcifer, a social parasite of the paper wasp P. dominulus, is able to reduce the aggressive reaction of its host. We found that the parasite lure elicited lower host aggressiveness than the conspecific lure, suggesting that parasite species have evolved cues able to inhibit host aggressiveness. We investigated separately the effects of chemical and visual patterns on host aggressiveness. The lower host reaction to the parasite lure was not due to chemical cues, but was elicited by the visual facial pattern of the parasite. Experimental manipulation of this visual pattern demonstrated that the black lower part of the clypeus of the parasite is the trait able to reduce host aggression. This pattern can be considered an honest signal since it visually amplifies the mandibular width, giving information about the parasite's dangerousness. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cuticular hydrocarbon; Nestmate recognition; Paper wasp; Polistes sulcifer; Social parasitism; Visual signal","aggression; chemical cue; conspecific; cuticle; evolutionary biology; honest signaling; host-parasite interaction; hydrocarbon; nestmate recognition; signal; social insect; social parasitism; specialization; visual cue; wasp; worker caste; Hexapoda; Polistes; Polistes dominulus; Polistes sulcifer; Polistinae",,,,,,"Bagnères, A., Lorenzi, M.C., Clément, J.-L., Dusticier, G., Turillazzi, S., Chemical usurpation of a nest by paper wasp parasites (1996) Science, 272, pp. 889-892; Branconi, R., (2010), Studio dei segnali visivi nel riconoscimento tra conspecifici di vespa cartonaia Polistes dominulus: dimensioni del corpo e colore del pattern facciale.

We manipulated the number of males (1, 2 or 4) and females (2, 4, 8 or 16) in a factorial design to investigate mating competition and courtship rate in Japanese medaka, a species with conventional sex roles, over a broad range of OSRs (0.0625 to 2), and in relation to the density of both sexes. As predicted, the rates of intrasexual interactions by both males and females increased with the number of competitors and decreased with the number of potential mates, whereas the rates of courtship decreased with the number of competitors and increased with the number of mates. At OSRs between 0.35 and 2, males engaged in more intrasexual interactions and courtship behaviour than females. However, females became the more competitive sex at OSRs less than 0.35, and engaged in more courtship than males at OSRs greater than 2, rather than at an OSR of 1, as predicted by conventional mating system theory.

For example, competitors should fight more fiercely for access to larger than smaller food items. However, this also depends on contestants' subjective value of the resource: individuals deprived of a given resource should value it more highly than individuals that recently had access to it. They should therefore be more aggressive and win contests more frequently. In some parasitoid species, adult females fight for hosts on which to lay eggs and feed. Using the parasitoid Eupelmus vuilleti, we investigated the effect on contest outcome of two factors affecting females' subjective host value: the quality of the habitat previously encountered by females (either rich or poor in hosts) and females' physiological state (i.e. the number of ready-to-lay eggs in their ovaries). Subjective host value should increase with both host scarcity and egg load. We first described the agonistic behaviours displayed by E. vuilleti females during contests and then verified that difference in habitat quality was perceived by females (they modified their host exploitation behaviours accordingly) but did not affect their egg load, so that the effects of both factors could be separated. Both habitat quality experience and egg load affected contest outcomes, with egg load asymmetry being the main factor in this species. Our results support game theoretical predictions. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Agonistic interaction; Eupelmus vuilleti; Female egg load; Female-female contest; Past experience; Physiological status; Previous habitat quality","aggression; contest competition; game theory; habitat quality; host-parasitoid interaction; intrasexual interaction; physiology; resource allocation; wasp; Animalia; Eupelmus vuilleti",,,,,,"Andersson, M., Iwasa, Y., Sexual selection (1996) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 11, pp. 53-58; Archer, J., Thanzami, V., The relation between physical aggression, size and strength, among a sample of young Indian men (2007) Personality and Individual Differences, 43, pp. 627-633; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Information gathering and decision making about resource value in animal contests (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 529-542; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Batchelor, T.P., Hardy, I.C.W., Barrera, J.F., Pérez-Lachaud, G., Insect gladiators II: competitive interactions within and between bethylid parasitoid species of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) (2005) Biological Control, 33, pp. 194-202; Bentley, T., Hull, T.T., Hardy, I.C.W., Goubault, M., The elusive paradox: owner-intruder roles, strategies, and outcomes in parasitoid contests (2009) Behavioral Ecology, 20, pp. 296-304; Bodin, A., Jaloux, B., Delbecque, J.-P., Vannier, F., Monge, J.-P., Mondy, N., Reproduction in a variable environment: how does Eupelmus vuilleti, a parasitoid wasp, adjust oogenesis to host availability?

It reflects the level of risk tolerated by the animals. However, animals frequently approached by nonthreatening humans may progressively learn that there will be no adverse consequence for them, and thus perceive a reduced level of risk. I used an optimality model to study how this habituation process and risk allocation strategies could interact to determine FID. First, I computed the optimal FID for a foraging animal confronted with a single kind of threat. In this situation, the model predicts that FID should increase with the level of risk perceived during each encounter, and decrease when encounters become more frequent. Next, I used the model to explore what could happen after the arrival of nonthreatening humans in the environment, assuming that, initially, only predators were present. I studied how these environmental modifications could progressively affect the expectations of the forager, and its FIDs towards predators and humans. The model predicts that risk allocation strategies may either facilitate or impede habituation to nonlethal disturbance, with conflicting effects on the FIDs. Depending on the initial predation regime, the disturbance conditions created by humans and the number of predators that remain after human arrival, the animal may either progressively accept the presence of nonthreatening humans or retain a high level of sensitivity towards both predators and humans. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Antipredator behaviour; Bayesian updating; Flight initiation distance; Human disturbance; Risk allocation","antipredator defense; Bayesian analysis; disturbance; flight; habituation; human activity; numerical model; predation; risk assessment; risk perception; strategic approach; tolerance; wildlife management; Animalia",,,,,,"Beauchamp, G., On the use of public information by social foragers to assess patch quality (2004) Oikos, 107, pp. 206-209; Beauchamp, G., Ruxton, G.D., Dilution games: use of protective cover can cause a reduction in vigilance for prey in groups (2007) Behavioral Ecology, 18, pp. 1040-1044; Béchet, A., Giroux, J.-F., Gauthier, G., The effects of disturbance on behaviour, habitat use and energy of spring staging snow geese (2004) Journal of Applied Ecology, 41, pp. 689-700; Bejder, L., Samuels, A., Whitehead, H., Finn, H., Alen, S., Impact assessment research: use and misuse of habituation, sensitisation and tolerance in describing wildlife responses to anthropogenic stimuli (2009) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 395, pp. 177-185; Bélanger, L., Bédard, J., Energetic costs of man-induced disturbance to staging snow geese (1990) Journal of Wildlife Management, 54, pp. 36-41; Berger, J.D., Daneke, J., Johnson, J., Berwick, S.H., Pronghorn foraging economy and predator avoidance in a desert ecosystem: implications for the conservation of large mammalian herbivores (1983) Biological Conservation, 25, pp. 193-208; Blumstein, D.T., Flight-initiation distance in birds is dependent on intruder starting distance (2003) Journal of Wildlife Management, 67, pp. 852-857; Blumstein, D.T., The multipredator hypothesis and the evolutionary persistence of antipredator behaviour (2006) Ethology, 112, pp. 209-217; Blumstein, D.T., Flush early and avoid the rush: a general rule of antipredator behavior?

Traditionally, skew has been thought of as a product of intrasexual competition. However, cooperatively breeding species often live in mixed-sex groups, so the behaviour of one sex has the potential to influence skew in the other. We addressed the importance of inter- and intrasexual conflict in determining reproductive skew through a study of paternity sharing in the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungus mungo. Unlike banded mongoose females, where reproductive skew is low, males exhibited high skew, with 85% of paternities being assigned to the three oldest males in each group. Individual males appeared unable to monopolize reproduction because females come into oestrus in synchrony and mate multiply. Instead, older males increased their success by mate guarding the oldest, most fecund females. Our findings therefore highlight the importance of mate choice in males and reveal the behavioural differences between the sexes that generate reproductive skew. They also emphasize the considerable influence that female behaviour can have on male reproductive skew. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Banded mongoose; Cooperative breeding; Intersexual conflict; Mate choice; Mate guarding; Mungos mungo; Reproductive skew","carnivore; cooperative breeding; fecundity; female behavior; intrasexual interaction; mammal; mate choice; mate guarding; paternity; reproductive success; sexual conflict; Carnivora; Mungos mungo",,,,,,"Amos, W., Worthington Wilmer, J., Kokko, H., Do female grey seals select genetically diverse mates?

Duets may contribute to pair bond maintenance, mate guarding or collaborative defence of resources. The degree of coordination between mates and the variety of vocalizations, however, vary considerably. Although only 3-4.3% of bird species have been reported to duet, this may be because studies have generally focused on conspicuous duets, and more private forms of duet might have been overlooked. We investigated private vocal communication between mates in wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, a gregarious Australian songbird that forms life-long pair bonds. The partners are inseparable unless nest building, incubating or brooding. Using microphones inside nestboxes, we monitored interactive communication between partners at the nest and its variation during different stages of breeding. After periods of separation, partners performed coordinated mutual vocal displays involving specific soft vocal elements that fulfilled all the criteria used to define duets. In addition, using playback experiments, we obtained preliminary results suggesting that these soft calls could allow mate recognition. Thus, we propose that mutual displays at the nest in zebra finches represent private vocal duets and may function to mediate pair bond maintenance. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acoustic communication; Pair bond; Private communication; Reproduction; Social monogamy; Songbird; Taeniopygia guttata; Vocal duet; Zebra finch","bioacoustics; mate guarding; monogamy; nest box; pair bond; songbird; vocalization; Aves; Passeri; Taeniopygia guttata",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Beletsky, L.D., Orians, G.H., Nest associated vocalisations of female red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus (1985) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 69, pp. 329-339; Benedict, L., Occurrence and life history correlates of vocal duetting in North American passerines (2008) Journal of Avian Biology, 39, pp. 57-65; Birkhead, T.R., Burke, T., Zann, R., Hunter, F.M., Krupa, A.P., Extra-pair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism in wild zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, revealed by DNA fingerprinting (1990) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 27, pp. 315-324; Clayton, D.F., Balakrishnan, C.N., London, S.E., Integrating genomes, brain and behavior in the study of songbirds (2009) Current Biology, 19, pp. R865-R873; Dabelsteen, T., Public, private or anonymous?

About 40% of the pups spend their time ashore to save energy, which can be allocated to growth or deposition of energy-rich adipose tissue. The other 60% of the pups enter the sea during suckling and the early postweaning period, and disperse to other locations within the breeding colony. Pups may swim distances up to 12. km. Neonatal aquatic dispersal behaviour may lead to increased energy expenditure for thermoregulation and swimming, and thus lead to a low rate of body mass gain during suckling and a high rate of body mass loss after weaning. Thus, we examined relationships between natal aquatic dispersal behaviour and change in body mass (ΔBM) in suckling and weaned pups. Suckling pups that had dispersed >2000. m had a significantly lower ΔBM than suckling pups that dispersed <2000. m or that did not disperse. In weaned pups, there were no effects of aquatic dispersal behaviour on ΔBM. We suggest that the bimodal natal aquatic dispersal behaviour in grey seals at the study site reflects two different strategies for postweaning survival: to stay ashore and get fat, or to take a swim and acquire diving and feeding skills. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Coastal ecology; Energetics; Grey seal; Halichoerus grypus; Marine ecology; Phocid; Thermoregulation","bioenergetics; body mass; breeding population; dispersal; growth rate; marine ecosystem; neonate; pinniped; resource allocation; suckling; survival; swimming; thermoregulation; weaning; Froan; Norway; Sor Trondelag; Halichoerus grypus; Phocidae",,,,,,"Alexander, R.M., The merits and implications of travel by swimming, flight and running for animals of different sizes (2002) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 42, pp. 1060-1064; Anderson, S.S., Harwood, J., Time budgets and topography: how energy reserves and terrain determine the breeding behaviour of grey seals (1985) Animal Behaviour, 33, pp. 1343-1348; Baker, J.R., Mortality and morbidity in grey seal pups (Halichoerus grypus).

We investigated the mechanisms promoting apparent foliage-age dietary mixing by a specialist sawfly, Pikonema alaskensis (Roh.) (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), within juvenile black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.). Field defoliation surveys indicated that larvae generally prefer developing foliage, and most defoliation occurs in the upper crown of trees. However, when upper-crown developing foliage becomes scarce, many larvae consume mature foliage in the upper crown rather than dispersing to lower branches, where preferred developing foliage remains abundant. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare the performance of early and late-instar larvae fed mixed versus individual age classes (i.e. developing or mature) of foliage in the upper and lower crown. In contrast to all past studies, foliage-age mixing by P. alaskensis was not associated with nutrient balancing or toxin dilution. Instead, mixing was associated with an expansion of feeding breadth in larvae as they developed, coupled with high levels of variation in resource quality between upper and lower crown levels, which enabled older larvae consuming mature foliage in the upper crown to achieve similar survival as those consuming developing foliage in the lower crown. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity in studies of foliage-age preference-performance relationships for herbivores within trees and demonstrates how a herbivore can use dietary mixing to dramatically expand its resources while simultaneously accounting for heterogeneity within large, architecturally complex plants. © 2010.","Complementary diet; Intra-tree variation; Ontogeny; Picea mariana; Pikonema alaskensis; Sawfly; Spatiotemporal","age class; coniferous forest; defoliation; dietary overlap; evergreen forest; foliage; herbivore; heterogeneity; host plant; insect; intraspecific variation; larva; ontogeny; plant-herbivore interaction; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; specialist; Animalia; Coniferophyta; Hymenoptera; Picea mariana; Pikonema alaskensis; Tenthredinidae",,,,,,"All, J.N., Benjamin, D.M., Influence of needle maturity on larval feeding preference and survival of Neodiprion swainei and N. rugifrons on jack pine, Pinus banksiana (1975) Annual Review of the Entomological Society of America, 68, pp. 579-584; Barbosa, P., Martinat, P., Waldvogel, M., Development, fecundity, and survival of the herbivore Lymantria dispar and the number of plant species in its diet (1986) Ecological Entomology, 11, pp. 1-6; Bartelt, R.J., Kulman, H.M., Jones, R.L., Effects of temperature on diapausing cocoons of the yellowheaded spruce sawfly, Pikonema alaskensis (1981) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 74, pp. 472-477; Behmer, S.T., Insect herbivore nutrient regulation (2009) Annual Review of Entomology, 54, pp. 165-187; Behmer, S.T., Simpson, S.J., Raubenheimer, D., Herbivore foraging in chemically heterogeneous environments: nutrients and secondary metabolites (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2489-2501; Behmer, S.T., Raubenheimer, D., Simpson, S.J., The effects of distance between foods on nutrient regulation in a highly mobile insect herbivore (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 665-675; Bernays, E.A., Chapman, R.F., (1994) Host Plant Selection in Phytophagous Insects, , Chapman & Hall, New York; Bernays, E.A., Minkenberg, P.J.M., Insect herbivores: different reasons for being a generalist (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1157-1169; Blüthgen, N., Metzner, A., Contrasting leaf age preferences of specialist and generalist stick insects (Phasmida) (2007) Oikos, 116, pp. 1853-1862; Carisey, N., Bauce É, Impact of balsam fir foliage age on sixth-instar spruce budworm growth, development, and food utilization (1997) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 27, pp. 257-264; Carroll, A.L., Physiological adaptation to temporal variation in conifer foliage by a caterpillar (1999) Canadian Entomologist, 131, pp. 659-669; Carroll, A.L., Quiring, D.T., Intra-tree variation in foliage development influences the foraging strategy of a caterpillar (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1978-1990; Cates, R.G., Feeding patterns of monophagous, oligophagous, and polyphagous insect herbivores: the effect of resource abundance and plant chemistry (1980) Oecologia, 46, pp. 22-31; Codella, S.G., Raffa, K.F., Contributions of female oviposition patterns and larval behavior to group defense in conifer sawflies (Hymenoptera: diprionidae) (1995) Oecologia, 103, pp. 24-33; Denno, R.F., McClure, M.S., (1983) Variable Plants and Herbivores in Natural and Managed Systems, , Academic Press, New York; Dethier, V.G., The feeding behavior of a polyphagous caterpillar (Diacrisia virginica) in its natural habitat (1988) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 66, pp. 1280-1288; Ernest, K.A., Insect herbivory on a tropical understory tree: effects of leaf age and habitat (1989) Biotropica, 21, pp. 194-199; Ewers, F., Schmid, R., Longevity of needle fascicles of Pinus longaveava (bristlecone pine) and other North American pines (1981) Oecologia, 51, pp. 107-115; Fox, L.R., Morrow, P.A., Specialization: species property or local phenomenon?

However, carrying armour and arms may impose energy costs that result in increased lactate and hence potential fatigue and there may be consequent effects on general activity. We investigated whether variation in shell and cheliped size influences lactate levels in hermit crabs. Lactate was positively related to residual cheliped size for both sexes and was higher in males than females; when we controlled for body size, the former had larger chelipeds. Shell weight unexpectedly had no effect on lactate but crabs in small shells had high lactate, possibly because of reduced ability to maintain a respiratory current. The size of natural shells had no effect on activity but the addition of food odour increased locomotion. However, activity was not related to lactate. We conclude that possession of larger chelipeds than expected for body size imposes significant costs and may limit development of sexual dimorphism. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cost of signals; Energy use; Hermit crab; Lactate; Pagurus bernhardus; Shell","bioenergetics; body size; crab; gastropod; locomotion; odor; reproductive cost; sexual dimorphism; shell; signal; weight; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Pagurus bernhardus",,,,,,"Allen, B., Levinton, J.S., Costs of bearing a sexually selected ornamental weapon in a fiddler crab (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 154-161; Andersson, M., Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird (1982) Nature, 299, pp. 818-820; Angel, J.E., Effects of shell fit on the biology of the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus (Say) (2000) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 243, pp. 169-184; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Fighting for shells: how private information about resource value changes hermit crab pre-fight displays and escalated fight behaviour (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 3011-3017; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Signal residuals and hermit crab displays: flaunt it if you have it!

We analysed a suite of alloparental behaviours (assessed via filming) in a kin-structured, high-density population of plurally breeding European badgers, Meles meles, which are not highly cooperative. Group members, other than mothers, performed alloparental behaviour; however, this was not correlated with their relatedness to within-group young. Furthermore, mothers babysat, allogroomed cubs without reciprocation, and allomarked cubs more than other members of the group (controlling for observation time). For welfare reasons, we could not individually mark cubs; however, the number observed pre-independence never exceeded that trapped. All 24 trapped cubs, in three filmed groups, were assigned both parents using 22 microsatellites. Mothers may breed cooperatively, as the time they babysat their assigned, or a larger, litter size did not differ. Furthermore, two mothers probably allonursed, as they suckled more cubs than their assigned litter size. An 18-year genetic pedigree, however, detected no short-term (litter size; maternal survival to the following year) or long-term (offspring breeding probability; offspring lifetime breeding success) fitness benefits with more within-group mothers or other members of the group. Rather, the number of other members of the group (excluding mothers) correlated negatively with long-term fitness. Mothers may tolerate other members of the group, as nonbreeders undertook more digging. Our study highlights that alloparental care varies on a continuum from that seen in this high-density badger population, where alloparenting behaviour is minimal, through to species where alloparental care is common and provides fitness benefits. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Allonursing; Alloparental care; CERVUS; Communal breeding; Cooperative breeding; Helper; Lifetime reproductive success; Meles meles; Microsatellite; Plural breeding","alloparental care; colonial breeding; cooperative breeding; eusociality; fitness; genetic marker; litter size; mustelid; polyandry; population density; reproductive cost; reproductive success; Mammalia; Meles meles",,,,,,"Brown, J.L., (1987) Helping and Communal Breeding in Birds.

We measured the behavioural type of 19 subordinates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher in their natural environment by quantifying six behavioural traits up to four times ('trials') in three different contexts, by presenting them with a conspecific intruder, a predator or nothing inside a tube. We found only moderate within-context repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficients) of the focal individual's behaviour, except for attacking either the conspecific or the predator inside the tube. The focal individual's attack rate of the tube was also positively affected by its group size. Averaging traits per context removed the between-trial variation, and consequently the across-context repeatability was very high for all six traits, except for territory maintenance. Trait values depended significantly on the context, except for territory defence. Consequently, individuals could be classified into different behavioural types based on their reaction towards the tube, but surprisingly, and opposite to laboratory studies in this species, ranging propensity and territory maintenance were not included in this behavioural syndrome. We suggest that more studies are needed to compare standardized focal personality tests (e.g. exploration propensity) with actual behaviour observed in nature (e.g. ranging and dispersal). © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal personality; Cichlidae; Cooperatively breeding cichlid; Helping behaviour; Lake Tanganyika; Neolamprologus pulcher; Repeatability of behavioural traits; Territory defence","behavioral ecology; cichlid; conspecific; cooperative breeding; decision making; defense behavior; dispersal; eusociality; group size; lake ecosystem; life history trait; reproductive strategy; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika; Animalia; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher",,,,,,"Armitage, K.B., Social dynamics of juvenile marmots: role of kinship and individual variability (1982) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 11, pp. 33-36; Armitage, K.B., Social and population dynamics of yellow-bellied marmots: results from long-term research (1991) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 22, pp. 379-407; Arnold, K.E., Owens, I.P.F., Goldizen, A.W., Division of labour within cooperatively breeding groups (2005) Behaviour, 142, pp. 1577-1590; Balshine, S., Leach, B., Neat, F., Reid, H., Taborsky, M., Werner, N., Correlates of group size in a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish (Neolamprologus pulcher) (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 50, pp. 134-140; Balshine-Earn, S., Neat, F.C., Reid, H., Taborsky, M., Paying to stay or paying to breed?

Males of the spider Argiope bruennichi are mostly monogynous; they damage their paired one-shot genitalia during copulation and fall victim to sexual cannibalism. Even males that are not cannibalized can achieve a maximum of two matings. Such a high mating effort implies that a male's reproductive success can be increased by selecting the best possible mate. Mate quality may depend on female mating status and/or fecundity. Males should be selected to prefer virgin females over mated ones since previously used female genital ducts can be blocked by genital mating plugs. Fecundity is a common approximation of female quality and in invertebrates is generally correlated with body size and mass. Argiope bruennichi females vary in body size and fecundity, providing a basis for male selectivity. By creating binary choice situations in field and laboratory experiments in which search costs were largely removed, we tested whether males show mate choice. There was weak evidence for a male preference based on female phenotype. However, virgin females were significantly preferred over mated females even if the virgin had a less fecund phenotype. We conclude that selective benefits of mating first with a female override potential benefits of choice based on female fecundity, leading to competition for virgin females. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Argiope bruennichi; Genital mutilation; Male mate choice; Mating plug; Orb-web spider; Protandry; Sexual cannibalism; Sexual conflict; Sexual selection","body mass; body size; cannibalism; copulation; fecundity; mate choice; phenotype; protandry; reproductive cost; reproductive success; secondary sexual characteristics; sexual conflict; sexual selection; spider; Araneae; Argiope bruennichi; Invertebrata",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Andrade, M.C.B., Risky mate search and male self-sacrifice in redback spiders (2003) Behavioral Ecology, 14, pp. 531-538; Andrade, M.C.B., Kasumovic, M.M., Terminal investment strategies and male mate choice: extreme tests of Bateman (2005) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 45, pp. 838-847; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Behavioral causes and consequences of sexual size dimorphism (2005) Ethology, 111, pp. 977-1016; Bonduriansky, R., The evolution of male mate choice in insects: a synthesis of ideas and evidence (2001) Biological Reviews, 76, pp. 305-339; Bonte, D., Deblauwe, I., Maelfait, J., Environmental and genetic background of tiptoe-initiating behaviour in the dwarfspider Erigone atra (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 169-174; Bonte, D., Hovestadt, T., Poethke, H.J., Evolution of dispersal polymorphism and local adaptation of dispersal distance in spatially structured landscapes (2010) Oikos, 119, pp. 560-566; Candolin, U., The use of multiple cues in mate choice (2003) Biological Reviews, 78, pp. 575-595; Charlesworth, D., Charlesworth, B., Inbreeding depression and its evolutionary consequences (1987) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 18, pp. 237-268; Chinta, S.P., Goller, S., Lux, J., Funke, S., Uhl, G., Schidz, S., The sex pheromone of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi (2010) Angewandte Chemie-International Edition, 49, pp. 2033-2036; Eason, F.R., Peck, W.B., Whitcomb, W.H., Notes on spider parasites, including a reference list (1967) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 40, pp. 422-434; Elgar, M.A., Schneider, J.M., The evolutionary significance of sexual cannibalism (2004) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 34, pp. 135-163; Elgar, M.A., De Crespigny, F.E.C., Ramamurthy, S., Male copulation behaviour and the risk of sperm competition (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 211-216; Foelix, R.F., (1996) Biology of Spiders, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Foellmer, M.W., Fairbairn, D.J., Competing dwarf males: sexual selection in an orb-weaving spider (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 629-641; Fromhage, L., Schneider, J.M., No discrimination against previous mates in a sexually cannibalistic spider (2005) Naturwissenschaften, 92, pp. 423-426; Fromhage, L., Elgar, M.A., Schneider, J.M., Faithful without care: the evolution of monogyny (2005) Evolution, 59, pp. 1400-1405; Fromhage, L., McNamara, J.M., Houston, A.I., A model for the evolutionary maintenance of monogyny in spiders (2008) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 250, pp. 524-531; Gaskett, A.C., Spider sex pheromones: emission, reception, structures, and functions (2007) Biological Reviews, 82, pp. 26-48; Gaskett, A.C., Herberstein, M.E., Downes, B.J., Elgar, M.A., Changes in male mate choice in a sexually cannibalistic orb-web spider (Araneae: Araneidae) (2004) Behaviour, 141, pp. 1197-1210; Head, G., Selection on fecundity and variation in the degree of sexual size dimorphism among spider species (Class Araneae) (1995) Evolution, 49, pp. 776-781; Herberstein, M.E., Schneider, J.M., Elgar, M.A., Costs of courtship and mating in a sexually cannibalistic orb-web spider: female mating strategies and their consequences for males (2002) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 51, pp. 440-446; Hoefler, C.D., Is contest experience a trump card?

This type of social organization is known as sexual segregation. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain sexual segregation but there is still no agreement as to the main cause. Since this behaviour is common in polygynous ungulate species, we hypothesized that sexual segregation evolved in response to the development of male competitive mating skills. To formalize this hypothesis, we developed an individual-based evolutionary model. In this model individuals interact to gain resources and social fighting skills, which ultimately determine their reproductive success. Individuals influence their social interactions by preferring to interact with a particular 'body size class' of individuals. This preference is a heritable trait. Robust social preferences evolve which produce significant levels of sexual segregation over a wide range of parameters. Segregation is particularly strong when the marginal fitness of fighting skills exceeds a certain threshold. The results are qualitatively consistent with independent comparative studies, although formal validation will require carefully designed experiments. This suggests a linkage between the evolution of sexual segregation and sexual dimorphism in ungulates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an evolutionary model has shown that sexual selection of fighting skills can drive sexual segregation in polygynous ungulates. © 2010.","Fighting skill; Polygyny; Sexual segregation; Sexual selection; Ungulate","behavioral response; body size; breeding season; evolutionary biology; experimental design; fighting; fitness; heritability; individual-based model; life history trait; polygyny; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; social organization; sperm competition; ungulate; Animalia; Ungulata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Abbott, D.H., Behaviourally mediated suppression of reproduction in female primates (1987) Journal of Zoology, 213, pp. 455-470; Abouheif, E., Fairbairn, D.J., A comparative analysis of allometry for sexual size dimorphism: assessing Rensch's rule (1997) American Naturalist, 149, pp. 540-562; Aitchison, J., The statistical-analysis of compositional data (1982) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B: Methodological, 44, pp. 139-177; Altmann, J., (1980) Baboon Mothers and Infants, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Altmann, J., Altman, S.A., Hausfater, G., Primate infant's effects on mother's future reproduction (1978) Science, 201, pp. 1028-1030; Appleby, M.C., Social rank and food access in red deer stags (1980) Behaviour, 74, pp. 294-309; Appleby, M.C., The consequences and causes of high social rank in red deer stags (1982) Behaviour, 80, pp. 259-273; Barboza, P.S., Bowyer, R.T., Seasonality of sexual segregation in dimorphic deer: extending the Gastrocentric model (2001) Alces, 37, pp. 275-292; Barrette, C., Vandal, D., Social rank, dominance, antler size, and access to food in snow-bound wild woodland caribou (1986) Behaviour, 97, pp. 118-146; Beatty, M.J., Heisel, A.D., Hall, A.E., Levine, T.R., La France, B.H., What can we learn from the study of twins about genetic and environmental influences on interpersonal affiliation, aggressiveness, and social anxiety?

We tested whether the strength of selection for flock size in redshanks, Tringa totanus, depended on hunting mode used by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus. Sparrowhawks prefer to ambush prey from cover, whereas peregrines normally attack from the open and use aerial pursuit. The success rate of surprise attacks should always decline with group size because of vigilance effects, and so should be similar for both predators. The success rate of nonsurprise attacks should decline with group size for peregrines because confusion effects apply, but not necessarily for sparrowhawks which quickly give up their chase. Consequently, peregrines should be more likely to attack smaller flocks than sparrowhawks to minimize confusion. Observations of 895 attacks, including 120 captures, confirmed these predictions. The decline in success rate with group size was the same for both predators for surprise attacks but was seen only for peregrines for nonsurprise attacks. Sparrowhawks attacked larger flocks than peregrines, although both species attacked small flocks with similar frequency. Our results suggest that the selective benefits of group size depend both on predator type and hunting mode, we assume because of variation in the importance of vigilance and confusion, and on relative predator abundance. Changes in prey group size may then change the strength of selection on vigilance and confusion effects by altering the relative attack frequency by different predators. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Confusion effect; Group living; Hunting success; Optimal group size; Predation risk; Prey vulnerability; Social behaviour; Vigilance","abundance; group behavior; group size; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; raptor; selection; vigilance; vulnerability; wader; Accipiter nisus; Falco peregrinus; Tringa; Tringa totanus",,,,,,"Botham, M.S., Kerfoot, C.J., Louca, V., Krause, J., Predator choice in the field; grouping guppies, Poecilia reticulata, receive more attacks (2005) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59, pp. 181-184; Carere, C., Montanino, S., Moreschini, F., Zoratto, F., Chiarotti, F., Santucci, D., Alleva, E., Aerial flocking patterns of wintering starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, under different predation risk (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 101-107; Caro, T.M., (2005) Antipredator Defenses in Birds and Mammals, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Cresswell, W., Escape responses by redshanks, Tringa totanus, on attack by avian predators (1993) Animal Behaviour, 46, pp. 609-611; Cresswell, W., Flocking is an effective anti-predation strategy in redshanks, Tringa totanus (1994) Animal Behaviour, 47, pp. 433-442; Cresswell, W., Surprise as a winter hunting strategy in sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus, peregrines Falco peregrinus and merlins F. columbarius (1996) Ibis, 138, pp. 684-692; Cresswell, W., Quinn, J.L., Predicting the optimal group-size for prey from predator hunting behaviour Journal of Animal Ecology, , In press; Cresswell, W., Whitfield, D.P., The effects of raptor predation on wintering wader populations at the Tyninghame estuary, southeast Scotland (1994) Ibis, 136, pp. 223-232; Cresswell, W., Lind, J., Quinn, J.L., Predator hunting success and prey vulnerability: quantifying the spatial scale over which lethal and non-lethal effects of predation occur (2010) Journal of Animal Ecology, 79, pp. 556-562; Dekker, D., Hunting success rates, foraging habits, and prey selection of peregrine falcons migrating through central Alberta (1980) Canadian Field-Naturalist, 94, pp. 371-382; Elgar, M.A., Predator vigilance and group size in mammals and birds: a critical review of the evidence (1989) Biological Review, 64, pp. 13-33; Elgar, M.A., Catterall, C.P., Flocking and predator surveillance in house sparrows: test of an hypothesis (1981) Animal Behaviour, 29, pp. 868-872; Fernandez-Juricic, E., Jokimaki, J., McDonald, J.C., Melado, F., Toledano, A., Mayo, C., Martin, B., Martin, V., Effects of opportunistic predation on anti-predator behavioural responses in a guild of ground foragers (2004) Oecologia, 140, pp. 183-190; Fitzgibbon, C.D., A cost to individuals with reduced vigilance in groups of Thomson's gazelles hunted by cheetahs (1989) Animal Behaviour, 37, pp. 508-510; Fitzgibbon, C.D., Why do hunting cheetahs prefer male gazelles?

If an intruder succeeds in taking over the carcass, it kills the entire brood and rears its own young on the remaining resource. However, the resident male and female are able to discriminate between an intruder and their breeding partner, and assist their mate in driving off intruders of either sex. Efficient brood guarding requires effective recognition and discrimination mechanisms. Theory predicts that the setting of the optimal acceptance threshold should be affected by the rates of interaction with desirable and undesirable individuals, and shift towards a less permissive threshold when the probability of encountering intruders increases. Here we provide a critical test of acceptance-threshold theory by investigating discrimination rules during reproduction in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. The beetles typically discriminate between their breeding partners and conspecific intruders based on a class-specific discrimination rule: they generally accept beetles that are also caring for larvae (whether their own partner or not), but are aggressive towards all nonbreeding beetles. However, we demonstrate that this recognition system is flexible at the level of individual experience and changes with context. After the introduction of an intruder, rejection rate increased, which was manifested as a shift from class-specific to individual-specific discrimination: males suddenly began discriminating between their own breeding partner and novel breeding females, and were more aggressive towards the latter. We show that the plasticity in the recognition system is not caused by template updating, but instead by a flexible acceptance threshold. Our experiments suggest that breeding males learn the individual features of their own breeding partner, but set their acceptance threshold depending on the risk of encountering an intruder. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acceptance threshold; Burying beetle; Chemical cue, template; Discrimination; Nicrophorus vespilloides; Partner recognition; Recognition system","aggression; beetle; brood rearing; chemical cue; conspecific; encounter rate; experimental study; individual variation; larva; mate recognition; parental care; risk assessment; threshold; Coleoptera; Nicrophorus vespilloides",,,,,,"Couvillon, M.J., Robinson, E.J.H., Atkinson, B., Child, L., Dent, K.R., Ratnieks, F.L.W., En garde: rapid shifts in honeybee, Apis mellifera, guarding behaviour are triggered by onslaught of conspecific intruders (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1653-1658; Davies, N.B., Brooke, M.D.L., Kacelnik, A., Recognition errors and probability of parasitism determine whether reed warblers should accept or reject mimetic cuckoo eggs (1996) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 263, pp. 925-931; Downs, S.G., Ratnieks, F.L.W., Adaptive shifts in honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) guarding behavior support predictions of the acceptance threshold model (2000) Behavioral Ecology, 11, pp. 326-333; Eggert, A.-K., Müller, J.K., Biparental care and social evolution in burying beetles: lessons from the larder (1997) The Evolution of Social Behavior in Insects and Arachnids, pp. 216-236. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, J.C.

Quantifying individual differences often requires researchers to capture and hold animals in captivity while short-term behavioural assays are recorded. We compared behavioural responses of adult, territorial Steller's jays in short- and long-term field assessments of behavioural traits in two ecological contexts, risk taking and exploration. Individuals' risk taking was similar in short-term and long-term contexts (i.e. alarm calling in the presence of a predator mount and while re-entering a trap, respectively). However, a measure of short-term exploration of a novel object in a feeding context was not related to a long-term index of annual habitat exploration (i.e. travel distance outside home territory). Risk-taking and exploration indices were correlated across ecological contexts, indicating that these traits contributed to a behavioural syndrome in jays. Annual assessments of risk-taking and exploration behaviours were repeatable. Individuals with high scores in risk taking and exploration were more likely to be recaptured in a familiar trap. We conclude that short-term experiments are adequate measures of specific behavioural strategies, but because short-term responses did not necessarily predict long-term annual behaviours in related contexts, expression of behavioural types and associated ecological strategies should be regarded as species and context specific. Long-lived residents are useful study species to overcome sampling biases for traits measured in captivity, because they provide opportunity to evenly sample a population over all personality types, including trap-shy individuals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural syndrome; Cyanocitta stelleri; Exploration; Personality; Repeatability; Risk taking; Steller's jay; Trapping success","alarm signal; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; bioassay; captivity; experimental study; individual variation; life history trait; passerine; sampling bias; trapping; Animalia; Corvidae; Cyanocitta stelleri",,,,,,"Bell, A.M., Stamps, J.A., Development of behavioural differences between individuals and populations of sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus (2004) Animal Behaviour, 68, pp. 1339-1348; Biro, P.A., Dingemanse, N.J., Sampling bias resulting from animal personality (2008) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 66-67; Black, J.M., (1996) Partnerships in Birds.

Swifts are highly adapted to a life in the air, showing wind-dependent orientation during nocturnal roosting flights, and may be expected to be more efficient in their wind drift/compensation behaviour than nocturnal passerine migrants, which are usually subjected to full or partial wind drift. A tracking radar at Lund in southern Sweden was used to record the orientation of common swifts (identified by their characteristic radar echo signature) on nocturnal migration flights and to measure wind conditions at the altitudes at which the birds were flying. Comparing track and heading directions under easterly and westerly winds revealed that the swifts shifted their heading distinctly into the wind, with the result that track directions were similar under the different wind conditions. As this pattern of complete compensation for drift from cross-winds occurred during both spring and autumn migration, there were no indications of differences between age classes. In addition, we found an effect of side-winds on equivalent airspeeds, with swifts increasing their airspeed with increasing wind speed. Such a response has been theoretically predicted as part of an optimal behaviour for counteracting wind drift but has hereto not been empirically demonstrated. There was also a positive correlation between overall wind speed and equivalent airspeed, making it difficult to interpret whether the swifts respond to the total wind speed rather than specifically to the side-wind effect. Our results suggest that important differences may exist between species in their capacities to orient in relation to the wind and that the swift may be particularly efficient in adjusting heading direction and airspeed to obtain complete compensation for wind drift during high-altitude nocturnal migratory flights. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apus apus; Common swift; Compensation; Drift; Migration; Orientation; Side-wind; Tracking radar; Wind","adaptive radiation; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; compensation; flight; migratory behavior; nocturnal activity; passerine; radar; seasonal variation; waterfowl; wind velocity; Sweden; Apus apus; Aves; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Åkesson, S., Coastal migration and wind drift compensation in nocturnal passerine migrants (1993) Ornis Scandinavica, 24, pp. 87-94; Åkesson, S., Avian long-distance navigation: experiments with migratory birds (2003) Avian Migration, pp. 471-492. , Springer-Verlag, Berlin, P.

Every time an observation is made, edges are drawn between each pair of individuals involved. I examined the effect of edge sample size on the reconstruction of social networks. I created different artificial networks and sampled edges from each. I estimated and compared the number of nodes, number of components, path length, clustering coefficient, network density, mean degree, betweenness centrality and degree probability distribution of the reconstructed networks to the true value of the network. I describe how the accuracy of these measures changes as the fraction of sampled edges increases. I show that edge sample size affects network measures in different ways and that when an incomplete sample is analysed, network properties can be considerably misrepresented. I also show that, because animal networks are typically small, simple curve fitting to the degree distribution P(k) should be done with caution, because different curve models can show significant fit for the same data. Overall, the results indicate that strong claims about animal social networks should not be made unless considerable effort has been made to collect an exhaustive number of association/interaction data points. If observations of associations/interactions are accumulated over a long period, the effect of increasing edge sample size could be mistaken for temporal change in social network and could also muddy the comparison of network structure between populations and between species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal social network;

This resistance to enrichment is often explained via mechanisms that decouple abnormal behaviour from current welfare, such as 'establishment': a hypothetical process whereby repetition increases behaviour's predictability and resistance to change. If such hypotheses are correct, then animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should still find enrichments rewarding. Alternatively, this behaviour could reflect a failure to improve welfare: plausible because age and chronic stress increase neophobia and anhedonia. If this hypothesis is correct, animals with enrichment-resistant stereotypic behaviour should value enrichments less than conspecifics. We tested these hypotheses using C57BL/6 mice, Mus musculus, aged 10-11 and 6-7 months, raised in barren laboratory cages. We observed their behaviour in both these and large enriched cages. Enrichment was more effective on the younger animals. However, contrary to ideas about establishment, the spontaneous predictability of stereotypic behaviour did not increase with age; nor was enrichment less effective on more predictable or time-consuming forms. We assessed the reward value of enriched cages by allowing access via progressively weighted doors (maximum weight pushed corresponding to peak motivation). In older mice, those individuals whose stereotypic behaviour was least reduced by enrichment were also the least motivated to gain access to enrichment. This suggests that the welfare of middle-aged-animals, as well as their stereotypic behaviour, is harder to improve using environmental enrichment. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Age; Animal welfare; Enrichment; Establishment; Laboratory mice; Motivation; Mus musculus; Reward value; Stereotypic behaviour","age structure; animal welfare; captive population; enrichment; hypothesis testing; laboratory method; rodent; stereotypic behavior; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus",,,,,,"Ames, A., (1994) The Welfare and Management of Bears in Zoological Gardens, , Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, Potters Bar; Augustsson, H., Van de Weerd, H.A., Kruitwagen, C.L.J.J., Baumans, V., Effect of enrichment on variation and results in the light/dark test (2003) Laboratory Animals, 37, pp. 328-340; Baker, K.C., Advanced age influences chimpanzee behavior in small social groups (2000) Zoo Biology, 19, pp. 111-119; Benus, R.F., den Daas, S., Koolhaas, J.M., van Oortmerssen, G.A., Routine-formation and flexibility in social and nonsocial behaviour of aggressive and non-aggressive male mice (1990) Behaviour, 112, pp. 176-193; Bondi, C.O., Rodriguez, G., Gould, G.G., Frazer, A., Morilak, D.A., Chronic unpredictable stress induces a cognitive deficit and anxiety-like behavior in rats that is prevented by chronic antidepressant drug treatment (2008) Neuropsychopharmacology, 33, pp. 320-331; Burghardt, G., (2005) The Genesis of Animal Play: Testing the Limits, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Clubb, R., (2001), Factors affecting the development of abnormal, stereotyped behaviour in zoo-housed carnivores.

When resources are movable a relatively open empirical question concerns how potential competitors recognize that another individual has a claim on a resource and when such claims should be respected. Here we address these dual features of competition in free-ranging rhesus monkeys by creating a competitive foraging task involving two food options, and for each condition, manipulating different aspects of the competitor's potential competitive advantage. Specifically, we focused on aspects of the competitor's physical connection to the food, and his attentional state and proximity. Results show that if the competitor had a physical connection to the food, rhesus respected the competitor's claim. Even when this connection had been temporarily relinquished, rhesus nevertheless respected the competitor's claim so long as proximity and attention to the resource were maintained. If, however, the competitor maintained a physical connection to one food source, but attended away from the food, subjects no longer respected the competitive advantage. Lastly, if a physical connection was made to one food option, but the experimenter was proximate to the other option, subjects were at chance in their choice, suggesting that proximity and physical connection represent conflicting competitive cues. These results reveal that rhesus monkeys use a variety of cues when recognizing and respecting competitive advantages. We discuss these results in relation to recent research on the evolution and ontogeny of our concepts of property and ownership. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Competition; Ownership; Possession; Recognizing ownership; Respecting ownership; Rhesus macaque","competitive displacement; food availability; foraging efficiency; intraspecific competition; ontogeny; primate; range size; resource availability; Animalia; Macaca; Macaca mulatta",,,,,,"Blake, P., Harris, P., Children's understanding of ownership transfers (2009) Cognitive Development, 24, pp. 133-145; Burt, A., Trivers, R.L., (2006) Genes in Conflict: the Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cram, F., Ng, S.H., Children's endorsement of ownership attributes (1989) Journal of Economic Psychology, 10, pp. 63-75; Davies, N.B., Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Parage aegeria): the resident always wins (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 138-147; Flombaum, J.I., Santos, L.R., Rhesus monkeys attribute perceptions to others (2005) Current Biology, 15, pp. 447-452; Friedman, O., First possession: an assumption guiding inferences about who owns what (2008) Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 15, pp. 290-295; Friedman, O., Neary, K.R., Determining who owns what: do children infer ownership from first possession?

Although many studies have suggested ways in which directional signal design might have behavioural significance among vocally interacting individuals, there are few direct tests using experimental approaches. During the breeding season and while fasting on land, male northern elephant seals produce airborne threat calls during dyadic interactions when competing for mating opportunities. In this study, we investigated the directional cues of these calls and tested hypotheses regarding directional signalling with respect to the behaviour of receivers during vocally mediated male agonistic interactions. We then determined effects of vocal directionality on receiver responses using an acoustic playback approach. We found that male calls had substantial directionality, particularly at higher frequencies (>1000. Hz). Subordinate males responded more strongly by retreating when the caller faced the receiver compared to when the caller was at a right angle or faced away. We also found a significant difference in responses to playback sequences with different call directivity patterns. Males displayed significantly more negative phonotaxis (i.e. moved away) in response to playbacks that simulated a caller oriented towards them compared to when playbacks simulated a caller oriented away from them. These results suggest that the directionality of threat calls provides important information about the auditory scene and spatial orientation of conspecifics and that this trait, along with the receiver's ability to extract this information, may have evolved as a consequence of its effect on the breeding success and fitness of the individual. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Intrasexual competition; Mirounga angustirostris; Northern elephant seal; Pinniped; Playback; Seal; Sound radiation pattern; Vocal behaviour; Vocal communication; Vocal directionality","agonistic behavior; auditory cue; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; breeding season; fitness; frequency analysis; hypothesis testing; intrasexual interaction; life history trait; numerical model; pinniped; reproductive success; vocalization; Animalia; Mirounga angustirostris; Pinnipedia",,,,,,"Bartholomew, G.A., Collias, N.E., The role of vocalization in the social behaviour of the northern elephant seal (1962) Animal Behaviour, 10, pp. 7-14; Brumm, H., Sound radiation patterns in nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) songs (2002) Journal of Ornithology, 143, pp. 468-471; Brumm, H., Todt, D., Facing the rival: directional singing behaviour in nightingales (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 43-53; Brumm, H., Slabbekoorn, H., Acoustic communication in noise (2005) Advances in the Study of Behavior.

Although birdsong has been studied for many years, it has only recently been suggested that it is a multifaceted signal that could encompass multiple sexually selected traits. According to the theories on the evolution and maintenance of multiple sexually selected signals, the different components of birdsong may signal multiple, redundant or unreliable information on male quality. We used a cross-sectional approach to examine whether the expression of song in the great tit was differentially related to any of three measures of quality: age, condition and survival. We analysed several informative characteristics in great tit song concerning diversity, output, performance and consistency to see whether different traits were simultaneously related to the studied quality parameters, or if, in contrast, each song trait was related to only one of the measures of quality. Song consistency and repertoire size were strongly related to only one of the studied parameters (age and survival, respectively), indicating that different song traits signal specific quality characteristics, and providing, therefore, evidence to support the multiple-signal hypothesis. Moreover, measures of song performance and song output (phrase and strophe rate) correlated positively with repertoire size, which might indicate that, at the same time, great tit song is signalling redundant information. In addition, some song characteristics did not correlate with any of the quality parameters measured, suggesting that those song traits might provide unreliable information. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Birdsong; Great tit; Multiple signalling; Parus major; Sexual selection","age structure; cross section; gene expression; hypothesis testing; interspecific interaction; life history trait; mate choice; parameterization; sexual selection; signal; songbird; species diversity; survival; Parus major",,,,,,"Amrhein, V., Johannessen, L.E., Kristiansen, L., Slagsvold, T., Reproductive strategy and singing activity: blue tit and great tit compared (2008) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 62, pp. 1633-1641; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Baker, M.C., Bjerke, T.K., Lampe, H., Espmark, Y., Sexual-responses of female great tits to variation in size of males' song repertoires (1986) American Naturalist, 128, pp. 491-498; Ballentine, B., The ability to perform physically challenging songs predicts age and size in male swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 973-978; Balsby, T.J.S., Hansen, P., Element repertoire: change and development with age in whitethroat Sylvia communis song (2010) Journal of Ornithology, 151, pp. 469-476; Bernard, D.J., Eens, M., Ball, G.F., Age- and behavior-related variation in volumes of song control nuclei in male European starlings (1996) Journal of Neurobiology, 30, pp. 329-339; Bischoff, L.L., Tschirren, B., Richner, H., Long-term effects of early parasite exposure on song duration and singing strategy in great tits (2009) Behavioral Ecology, 20, pp. 265-270; Botero, C.A., Rossman, R.J., Caro, L.M., Stenzler, L.M., Lovette, I.J., de Kort, S.R., Vehrencamp, S.L., Syllable type consistency is related to age, social status and reproductive success in the tropical mockingbird (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 701-706; Bro-Jørgensen, J., Dynamics of multiple signalling systems: animal communication in a world in flux (2010) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 25, pp. 292-300; Brooks, R., Kemp, D.J., Can older males deliver the good genes?

Specifically, we asked whether these individuals use recently acquired information when establishing their use of space during searching routines. Males find virgin females by patrolling the habitat for pheromone cues, with scramble competition following. To simulate emergences, we placed just-eclosed females in fine-meshed bags that permitted pheromones to disperse. Upon presentation, male swarms formed, reaching maximum numbers within the first few minutes. Males subsequently left the swarming site, and few revisited. Females were removed after 5. min and replaced by a second female. Male numbers remained low, but when the second female was then presented 15. m away, she attracted many males. Repeating the initial experiment with a hiatus of 30. min between first and second females, the second female attracted few males, but with a hiatus of 60. min between females, the second female attracted many males. There was no increase in the number of males that responded to a second female presented closer than 5. m from that of the first female. Wasp emergence patterns revealed that more than one female seldom eclosed within a diameter of 5. m on the same day. Thus, males show short-term memory of space and time that decreases their attention to sites that are unlikely to yield a mating. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alabagrus texanus; Braconidae; Mate searching; Pheromone; Scramble competition; Swarming","attractant; behavioral ecology; competition (ecology); dispersal; emergence; habitat type; host-parasite interaction; mate choice; numerical model; pheromone; quantitative analysis; spatial variation; swarming; wasp; Alabagrus; Braconidae; Vespoidea",,,,,,"Alcock, J., Kemp, D.J., The scramble competition mating system of the sphecid wasp Palmodes praestans (Kohl) (2005) Journal of Natural History, 39, pp. 2809-2814; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Antolin, M.F., Strand, J.L., Mating system of Bracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (1992) Ecological Entomology, 17, pp. 1-7; Askew, R.R., (1971) Parasitic Insects, , Heinemann, London; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Collatz, J., Tolasch, T., Steidle, J.L.M., Mate finding in the parasitic wasp Cephalonomia tarsalis (Ashmead): more than one way to a female's heart (2009) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 35, pp. 761-768; Danci, A., Gries, R., Schaefer, P.W., Gries, G., Evidence for four-component close-range sex pheromone in the parasitic wasp Glyptapanteles flavicoxis (2006) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 32, pp. 1539-1554; Eggleton, P., The male reproductive behaviour of Lytarmes maculipennis (Smith) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) (1990) Ecological Entomology, 15, pp. 357-360; Emlen, S.T., Oring, L.W., Ecology, sexual selection, and the evolution of mating systems (1977) Science, 197, pp. 215-223; von Frisch, K., (1967) The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees, , Belknap Press, Cambridge, Massachuetts; Godfray, H.C.J., (1994) Parasitoids, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Gordh, G., DeBach, P., Courtship behavior in the Aphytis lingnanensis group, its potential usefulness in taxonomy, and a review of sexual behavior in the parasitic Hymenoptera (Chalc.: Aphelinidae) (1978) Hilgardia, 46, pp. 37-75; Hastings, J.M., Dodson, G.N., Heckman, J.L., Male perch selection and the mating system of the robber fly, Promachus albifacies (Diptera: Asilidae) (1994) Journal of Insect Behavior, 7, pp. 829-841; McClure, M., McNeil, J.N., The effect of abiotic factors on the male mate searching behavior and the mating success of Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) (2009) Journal of Insect Behavior, 22, pp. 101-110; McClure, M., Whistlecraft, J., McNeil, J.N., Courtship behavior in relation to the female sex pheromone in the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (2007) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 33, pp. 1946-1959; Matthews, R.W., Matthews, J.O., Crankshaw, O., Aggregation in male parasitic wasps of the genus Megarhyssa.

Groups of animals will often contain individuals with a range of physiological states and the grazing behaviour of herbivores is affected by their physiological state. This study compared the grazing decisions of animals in groups of single and mixed physiological states. Using a grazing model that simulated individual herbivore behaviour in relation to environmental distributions of forage resource (grass) and parasites (faeces), we tested the hypothesis that an animal's level of parasite exposure via the faecal-oral route is affected by the composition of physiological states in the group. Four physiological states were considered: parasite-naïve, parasitized, lactating and parasite-immune animals. Baseline parasite exposure levels for each state were generated by simulating single-state groups and were compared to simulations of each of the six two-state combinations. In single-state groups parasitized animals had the least and lactating animals had the greatest levels of parasite exposure. When co-grazing with lactating animals, parasitized, immune and naïve animals increased their parasite exposure, relative to single-state groups. When co-grazing with parasitized animals, lactating, immune and naïve animals reduced their parasite exposure, relative to single-state groups. There was no difference in parasite exposure of the immune or naïve animals co-grazing together when compared to the single-state groups. These results highlight the need to recognize the impact of the individual when studying group-living animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Grazing; Group composition; Herbivore; Individual behaviour; Physiological state","behavioral ecology; community composition; developmental biology; environmental disturbance; forage; grazing; group behavior; herbivore; host-parasite interaction; hypothesis testing; immune system; lactation; numerical model; Animalia",,,,,,"(1993) Energy and Protein Requirements of Ruminants: an Advisory Manual Prepared by the AFRC Technical Committee on Responses to Nutrients, , CAB International, Wallingford, Agricultural and Food Research Council; Arnold, G.W., Influence of the biomass, botanical composition and sward height of annual pastures on foraging behaviour by sheep (1987) Journal of Applied Ecology, 24, pp. 759-772; Bao, J., Giller, P.S., Stakelum, G., Selective grazing by dairy cows in the presence of dung and the defoliation of tall grass dung patches (1998) Animal Science, 66, pp. 65-73; Bazely, D.R., Rules and cues used by sheep foraging monocultures (1990) Behavioural Mechanisms of Food Selection, pp. 343-367. , Springer-Verlag, London, R.N.

Parental care sexual conflict theory predicts that release from parental care translates to an increased propensity towards polygamous sexual behaviour. We hypothesized that homosexual behaviour(s) may be expected to increase in frequency for the sex that invests less in parental care and potentially enjoys increased mating opportunities. Consistent with our predictions, lower relative contribution to parental care for a particular sex is related to increased frequency of occurrence of homosexual behaviour. For males, highly polygynous species with minimal male parental investment exhibit higher frequencies of male homosexual behaviour, including male-male mounting and especially courtship. In socially monogamous species, male parental investment is greater, and the expression of male homosexual behaviour is lower. Similarly, among pair-bonding species, frequencies of male-male pair bonding increase with decreases in male contribution to care relative to females. When females of socially monogamous species provide less care than males, they exhibit higher frequencies of homosexual behaviour, namely pair bonding and courtship activities. Conversely, when females of polygynous species provide the bulk of parental care, female-female sexual behaviour is infrequently expressed. Homosexual behaviour in birds is more likely to occur under scenarios of enhanced mating opportunity without necessarily influencing reproductive success and thus may exist neutrally, or alternatively provide a behavioural template co-opted for adaptive design. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal homosexual behaviour; Bird; Female-female; Male-male; Parental care; Polygamy; Same-sex sexual behaviour; Sexual conflict","adaptive radiation; behavioral ecology; bird; courtship; frequency analysis; gene expression; homosexuality; hypothesis testing; parental care; parental investment; reproductive success; sexual behavior; sexual conflict; species diversity; species occurrence; Animalia; Aves",,,,,,"Adkins-Regan, E., Development of sexual partner preference in the zebra finch: a socially monogamous, pair-bonding animal (2002) Archives of Sexual Behavior, 31, pp. 27-33; Armstrong, E.A., (1965) Bird Display and Behavior.

In a series of recent studies conducted on spiders, it was shown that females develop preferences for novel, artificially modified male phenotypes when exposed to them as juveniles. However, because Schizocosa wolf spiders are known to respond to multiple sensory cues in mate choice, concerns have been raised about the use of nail polish to modify male visual phenotypes. Here we attempted to repeat the earlier experiment, but address effects of chemical versus visual learning separately, using the wolf spider species Schizocosa rovneri. Results indicate that exposure to novel visual/chemical male phenotypes influenced adult female mate preference for visual and to some extent chemical phenotypes, but in this case, females avoided familiar male phenotypes and preferred those to which they had not been exposed. Our results suggest that female mate preferences may be based on more factors than previously recognized, and that experience may reinforce behavioural isolation of species by increasing avoidance of mating with visually or chemically distinct male phenotypes. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Experimental design; Mate choice; Multimodal communication; Plasticity; Subadult experience; Wolf spider","adult; avoidance reaction; experimental design; female; juvenile; mate choice; phenotypic plasticity; preference behavior; sensory system; spider; Animalia; Araneae; Invertebrata; Lycosidae; Schizocosa; Schizocosa rovneri; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bakker, T.C.M., Milinski, M., Sequential female choice and the previous mate effect in sticklebacks (1991) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 29, pp. 205-210; Burley, N.T., Kratzenberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 444-455; Coleman, S.W., Patricelli, G.L., Borgia, G., Variable female preferences drive complex male displays (2004) Nature, 428, pp. 742-745; Collins, S.A., The effect of recent experience on female choice in zebra finches (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 479-486; Delaney, K.J., (1997), Communication in the context of courtship and aggression in two species of wolf spider (Araneae: Lycosidae).

Termed the 'Lombard effect', this reflexive behaviour is widespread among birds and mammals and occurs with a diversity of signal types, leading to the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation represents a general vertebrate mechanism for coping with environmental noise. Support for this evolutionary hypothesis, however, remains limited due to a lack of studies in taxa other than birds and mammals. Here, we report the results of an experimental test of the hypothesis that male grey treefrogs increase the amplitude of their advertisement calls in response to increasing levels of chorus-shaped noise. We recorded spontaneously produced calls in quiet and in the presence of noise broadcast at sound pressure levels ranging between 40 dB and 70 dB. While increasing noise levels induced predictable changes in call duration and rate, males did not regulate call amplitude. These results do not support the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation is a generic vertebrate mechanism for coping with noise. We discuss the possibility that intense sexual selection and high levels of competition for mates in choruses place some frogs under strong selection to call consistently as loudly as possible. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acoustic communication; Frog; Gray treefrog; Lombard effect; Noise","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; competition (ecology); frog; functional morphology; hypothesis testing; noise; pressure effect; sexual selection; species diversity; taxonomy; Anura; Aves; Hyla; Hyla chrysoscelis; Hyla versicolor; Mammalia; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Arch, V.S., Grafe, T.U., Narins, P.M., Ultrasonic signalling by a Bornean frog (2008) Biology Letters, 4, pp. 19-22; Bee, M.A., Sound source segregation in grey treefrogs: spatial release from masking by the sound of a chorus (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 549-558; Bee, M.A., Finding a mate at a cocktail party: spatial release from masking improves acoustic mate recognition in grey treefrogs (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 1781-1791; Bee, M.A., Parallel female preferences for call duration in a diploid ancestor of an allotetraploid treefrog (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 845-853; Bee, M.A., Micheyl, C., The cocktail party problem: what is it?

One presumed advantage of such sharing is that it enables 'song matching' (i.e. responding to an interactant with the song he just sang or another song of the interactant's repertoire). Song sharing probably arises through song learning, whereby males of some species prefer acquiring songs shared in the local population. However, such a preference may lead to uniformity of repertoires, devaluating the signal value of shared songs. Here we investigated repertoire composition in a local population of nightingales. More precisely, we analysed the number of song types shared by a given number of males and compared the finding with different simulated models of song acquisition. We found that proportions of both (songs shared by many males as well as songs sung by a single male only) were clearly more common than expected. We also simulated the cultural evolution of the population's repertoire. The results of these simulations supported our conclusion from the simulation of song acquisition that unshared songs arise through invention of novel song types or modification of existing ones, although we cannot rule out that unshared songs also appear through immigration of males. Our findings suggest that nightingales have a preference to acquire both shared song types, which enable matching the songs of opponents, and unshared or 'invented' new song types, which may help to avoid being matched by opponents. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Birdsong; Common nightingale; Communication; Cultural evolution; Luscinia megarhynchos; Repertoire composition; Song sharing","cultural change; learning; male; population distribution; signal; songbird; Luscinia megarhynchos; Passeri",,,,,,"Amrhein, V., Korner, P., Naguib, M., Nocturnal and diurnal singing activity in the nightingale: correlations with mating status and breeding cycle (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 939-944; Beecher, M.D., Campbell, S.E., The role of unshared songs in singing interactions between neighbouring song sparrows (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 1297-1304; Beecher, M.D., Campbell, S.E., Stoddard, P.K., Correlation of song learning and territory establishment strategies in the song sparrow (1994) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 91, pp. 1450-1454; Beecher, M.D., Stoddard, P.K., Campbell, E.S., Horning, C.L., Repertoire matching between neighbouring song sparrows (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 917-923; Beecher, M.D., Campbell, S.E., Nordby, J.C., Territory tenure in song sparrows is related to song sharing with neighbours, but not to repertoire size (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 29-37; Bentley, R.A., Hahn, M.W., Shennan, S.J., Random drift and culture change (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. 1443-1450; Bortz, J., Lienert, G.A., Boehnke, K., (1990) Verteilungsfreie Methoden in der Biostatistik, , Springer, Berlin; Burt, J.M., Campbell, S.E., Beecher, M.D., Song type matching as threat: a test using interactive playback (2001) Animal Behaviour, 62, pp. 1163-1170; Catchpole, C.K., Slater, P.J.B., (2008) Birdsong: Biological Themes and Variations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Hahn, M.W., Bentley, R.A., Drift as a mechanism for cultural change: an example from baby names (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Supplement, 270, pp. S120-S123; Hultsch, H., (1980), Beziehungen zwischen Struktur, zeitlicher Variabilität und sozialem Einsatz des Gesangs der Nachtigall (Luscinia megarhynchos B.).

To minimize observer effects, researchers often habituate their study animals. The premise of this method is that, with sufficient neutral exposure, animals will stop reacting to humans. While numerous studies demonstrate that negative responses to humans decrease over time, the fact that an animal does not flee from or behave aggressively towards observers cannot be taken as evidence that it is not altering its behaviour in other, more subtle ways. Because remotely monitoring the behaviour of wild animals is difficult, it has not been possible to answer the critical question: do habituated animals change their behaviour when researchers are present? Here, we use data from an automated radiotelemetry system that remotely monitored the movement and activity of radiocollared animals to test whether observers affected the behaviour of seven habituated white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. We found no evidence that observers influenced the ranging behaviour or activity patterns of their study subjects. Capuchins did not move faster, stop to rest less frequently, or display higher levels of activity when they were being followed compared to when they were alone. It has been suggested that researchers may embolden habituated study subjects, artificially increasing their relative dominance, but we found no relationship between observer presence and proximity to neighbouring social groups. Although it remains possible that observer effects existed but were too subtle to be detected with the remote sensing technology we used, the results of this study nevertheless provide reassuring evidence that humans can observe habituated wild animals without overly influencing the animals' activity and movement patterns. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Barro Colorado Island, Panama; Cebus capucinus; Habituation; Telemetry","aggression; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; dominance; habitat type; habituation; movement; primate; radiotelemetry; remote sensing; wild population; Barro Colorado Island; Panama [Central America]; Panama [Panama (NTN)]; Animalia; Cebidae; Cebus capucinus; Primates",,,,,,"Aguiar, L.M., Moro-Rios, R.F., The direct observational method and possibilities for Neotropical carnivores: an invitation for the rescue of a classical method spread over the primatology (2009) Zoologia, 26, pp. 587-593; Baker, R.L., McGuffin, M.A., Technique and observer presence affect reporting of behavior of damselfly larvae (2007) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 26, pp. 145-151; Bertolani, P., Boesch, C., Habituation of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) of the South group at Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire: empirical measure of progress (2008) Folia Primatologica, 79, pp. 162-171; Blom, A., Cipolletta, C., Brunsting, A.M.H., Prins, H.H.T., Behavioral responses of gorillas to habituation in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park, Central African Republic (2004) International Journal of Primatology, 25, pp. 179-196; Caine, N.G., Unrecognized anti-predator behaviour can bias observational data (1989) Animal Behaviour, 39, pp. 195-197; Carpenter, C.R., A field study of the behavioral and social relations of howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata) (1934) Comparative Psychology Monographs, 10, pp. 1-168; Cipolletta, C., Effects of group dynamics and diet on the ranging patterns of a western gorilla group (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) at Bai Hokou, Central African Republic (2004) American Journal of Primatology, 64, pp. 193-205; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Maccoll, A., Chadwick, P., Gaynor, D., Kansky, R., Skinner, J.D., Reproduction and survival of suricates (Suricata suricatta) in the southern Kalahari (1999) African Journal of Ecology, 37, pp. 69-80; Connor, R.C., Smolker, R.S., Habituated dolphins (Tursiops sp) in Western Australia (1985) Journal of Mammalogy, 66, pp. 398-400; Crofoot, M.C., Mating and feeding competition in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus): the importance of short- and long-term strategies (2007) Behaviour, 144, pp. 1473-1495; Crofoot, M.C., (2008), Intergroup competition in white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus): automated radio-telemetry reveals how intergroup relationships shape space-use and foraging success.

In the Iberian Peninsula, the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans, and other exotic freshwater turtles have been introduced, competing and displacing the native endangered terrapins (the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, and the Spanish terrapin, Mauremys leprosa). Although the nature of competitive interactions remains unclear, direct competition for food is likely to occur. Both native and invasive freshwater turtles are common predators of amphibian tadpoles. Naïve amphibian tadpoles are known to recognize and respond to local predators with no prior experience, but tadpoles might not recognize new predatory species, since they have not shared a long evolutionary history with them. We examined the ability of four species of Iberian anuran tadpoles to recognize and respond to chemical cues from invasive and native freshwater predatory turtles. Three of the four tadpole species tested reduced their swimming activity when cues from native turtles were present in water, but not when cues belonged to exotic turtles. This inability of tadpole prey to respond innately to chemicals from introduced predatory turtles might be one of the causes that explains the displacement of native populations of Iberian terrapins by invasive exotic turtles, and may help clarify why alien predators sometimes prosper better in new habitats than locally adapted predators. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alien predator; Amphibian tadpole; Chemoreception; Freshwater turtle; Invasion; Predation risk","adaptive radiation; biological invasion; chemical cue; chemoreception; competition (ecology); endangered species; freshwater environment; frog; habitat type; invasive species; native species; population structure; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; recognition; species diversity; species occurrence; swimming behavior; turtle; Iberian Peninsula; Amphibia; Emydidae; Emys; Emys orbicularis; Mauremys leprosa; Testudines; Trachemys scripta elegans",,,,,,"Allendorf, F.W., Lundquist, L.L., Introduction: population biology, evolution, and control of invasive species (2003) Conservation Biology, 17, pp. 24-30; Arnold, E.N., Ovenden, D.W., (2002) A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibians of Britain and Europe, , Harper Collins, London; (2004) Guidelines for Use of Live Amphibians and Reptiles in Field and Laboratory Research, , Lawrence/Herpetological Animal Care and Use Committee (HACC) of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, Kansas, ASIH; Azevedo-Ramos, C., Magnusson, W.E., Tropical tadpole vulnerability to predation: association between laboratory results and prey distribution in an Amazonian savanna (1999) Copeia, 1999, pp. 58-67; Baber, M.J., Babbitt, K.J., The relative impacts of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland tadpole assemblage (2003) Oecologia, 136, pp. 289-295; Blossey, B., Nötzold, R., Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis (1995) Journal of Ecology, 83, pp. 887-889; Bosch, J., Rincón, P.A., Boyero, L., Martínez-Solano, I., Effects of introduced salmonids on a montane population of Iberian frogs (2006) Conservation Biology, 20, pp. 180-189; Cadi, A., Joly, P., Competition for basking places between the endangered European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis galloitalica) and the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) (2003) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 81, pp. 1392-1398; Callaway, R.M., Aschehoug, E.T., Invasive plants versus new and old neighbors: a mechanism for exotic invasion (2000) Science, 290, pp. 521-523; Chivers, D.P., Smith, R.J.F., Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, acquire predator recognition when alarm substance is associated with the sight of unfamiliar fish (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 597-605; Chivers, D.P., Smith, R.J.F., Free-living fathead minnows rapidly learn to recognize pike as predators (1995) Journal of Fish Biology, 46, pp. 949-954; Chivers, D.P., Wildy, E.L., Kiesecker, J.M., Blaustein, A.R., Avoidance response of juvenile pacific tree frogs to chemical cues of introduced predatory bullfrogs (2001) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 27, pp. 1667-1676; Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., From evolution to behavior: evolutionary psychology as the missing link (1987) The Latest on the Best: Essays on Evolution and Optimality, pp. 277-306. , The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, J.

Nevertheless, polyandry is not rampant, suggesting that realized polyandry is the outcome of costs and benefits associated with multiple matings. In the bivoltine green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi, females gain from mating multiply as males transfer a substantial nuptial gift along with the sperm at mating. None the less, lifetime number of matings varies between one and six, and 12% of females mate only once. We investigated the reason for this variation and tested: (1) whether female polyandry is contingent on environmental conditions (specifically whether females can compensate for adverse conditions by mating more often); and (2) whether the level of polyandry differs between the diapausing generation, which flies after pupal hibernation, and the directly developing generation (specifically whether females in the more time-constrained summer generation are more polyandrous, possibly as a result of selection for early high mating propensity and thereby shorter prereproductive period). Results showed that: (1) females did not compensate for adverse conditions by mating more often; and (2) the level of polyandry was higher in the directly developing generation than in the diapause generation. Hence, we argue that differences in time stress and mating propensity between generations interplay in shaping mating frequency, and that the difference in polyandry between generations highlights the importance of integrating developmental pathway and life history. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Diapause; Evolution; Green-veined white butterfly; Life history; Mating rate; Monandry; Phenotypic plasticity; Pieris napi; Polyandry; Voltinism","butterfly; compensation; cost-benefit analysis; developmental biology; environmental conditions; functional morphology; generation time; hibernation; life history; mating behavior; nuptial gift; phenotypic plasticity; polyandry; pupa; reproductive success; voltinism; Hexapoda; Pieris brassicae; Pieris napi",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Leimar, O., Nylin, S., Wiklund, C., The effect of flexible growth rates on optimal sizes and development times in a seasonal environment (1996) American Naturalist, 147, pp. 381-395; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 145-164; Arnqvist, G., Edvardsson, M., Friberg, U., Nilsson, T., Sexual conflict promotes speciation in insects (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 97, pp. 10460-10464; Bergström, J., Wiklund, C., Effects of size and nuptial gifts on butterfly reproduction: can females compensate for a smaller size through male-derived nutrients?

We investigated the association patterns of female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia and found that they depended upon the complex interplay of at least three factors: home range overlap, matrilineal kinship and biparental kinship. While home range overlap was positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred associations were found between females showing as little as 27% home range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100% home range overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations took place between females that were more closely biparentally related than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether or not pairs of females shared the same matriline. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bottlenose dolphin; Home range; HWI; Kinship; Relatedness; Social evolution; Tursiops aduncus","avoidance reaction; community composition; dolphin; female; functional morphology; home range; kinship; niche overlap; Australia; Shark Bay; Western Australia; Chondrichthyes; Mammalia; Tursiops; Tursiops aduncus",,,,,,"Amos, B., Hoezel, A.R., Long-term preservation of whale skin for DNA analysis (1991) Genetic Ecology of Whales and Dolphins, pp. 99-103. , International Whaling Commission, Cambridge, A.R.

Yet, across many species, offspring remain with their parents after independence rather than disperse. Why some species live in family groups and the behavioural mechanisms influencing the extent of family living remain unresolved. Family living is predicted to arise through slow life history traits predisposing certain lineages to family living, and then through social and ecological factors resulting in greater benefits of remaining with parents compared to dispersing. We studied family living in the western slaty-antshrike, Thamnophilus atrinucha, a bird with a slow life history, in Panama. We quantified the extent of delayed dispersal, and examined both the behavioural mechanisms influencing dispersal as well as the survival consequences. We observed that delayed dispersal increased offspring survival. Parental aggression towards offspring increased with offspring age and, in particular, when parents renested. Thus, offspring dispersed earlier when their parents renested. Fledging date and mass of offspring also influenced timing of dispersal. Although we observed higher survival of delayed dispersers, only a small proportion of offspring delayed dispersal until the next year and all dispersed to wander within other breeding pairs' territories (i.e. 'float'). Our results support theoretical predictions stating that benefits to parents from offspring retention decrease with offspring age and with renesting, leading to natal dispersal. Furthermore, we observed a reduced survival benefit of retention once offspring reached a certain age. Examining parental tolerance, the costs of floating, and how they vary with offspring age are essential to understand the costs/benefits of family living. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Delayed dispersal; Family living; Natal dispersal; Parent-offspring conflict; Thamnophilus atrinucha; Tropical; Western slaty-antshrike","aggression; cost-benefit analysis; fledging; group behavior; life history trait; natal dispersal; Neotropical Region; parent-offspring interaction; passerine; reproductive cost; reproductive success; spatial variation; survival; territory; tolerance; Panama [Central America]; Panama [Panama (NTN)]; Aves; Thamnophilus atrinucha",,,,,,"Baglione, V., Canestrari, D., Marcos, J.M., Ekman, J., Experimentally increased food resources in the natal territory promote offspring philopatry and helping in cooperatively breeding carrion crows (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 1529-1535; Brawn, J.D., Karr, J.R., Nichols, J.D., Robinson, W.D., Demography of tropical forest birds in Panama: how do transients affect estimates of survival rates?

Theory predicts that agonistic signals should vary with RHP and any decision to 'give up' should be made by the opponent with lower RHP. In some species, an encounter is only resolved when one opponent is killed or critically injured. We investigated fatal fighting between groups of red wood ants, Formica rufa, and determined whether the probability that a focal group inflicts the first fatality in an encounter is influenced by the same correlates of RHP demonstrated to affect noninjurious fight outcome. In addition, we manipulated group size, an additional factor which is likely to be linked to RHP during intergroup conflicts, to determine whether members of larger groups concentrate attacks on their less numerous opponents. We found that, during most encounters, focal groups that inflicted the first fatality contained individuals of larger mean body mass than groups that received the first fatality. There was no evidence that energetic status directly influenced outcome, although groups that received the first fatality experienced a significant reduction in total body sugar compared to nonfighting controls. Finally, we found no evidence to suggest F. rufa concentrate their attacks in a way that leads to enhanced group RHP. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Body size; Energetic status; Formica rufa; Group size; Lanchester's attrition laws; Red wood ant; Resource-holding potential; Weapon","ant; bioenergetics; biological weapon; body mass; body size; fighting; group behavior; group size; resource selection; signal; wood; Formica rufa; Formicidae",,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Boundary disputes in the territorial ant Azteca trigona: effects of asymmetries in colony size (1990) Animal Behaviour, 39, pp. 321-328; Adams, E.S., Mesterton-Gibbons, M., Lanchester's attrition models and fights among social animals (2003) Behavioral Ecology, 14, pp. 719-723; Anderson, C., Franks, N.R., Teams in animal societies (2001) Behavioral Ecology, 12, pp. 534-540; Bolker, B.M., Brooks, M.E., Clark, C.J., Geange, S.W., Poulsen, J.R., Stevens, M.H.H., White, J.-S.S., Generalized linear mixed models: a practical guide for ecology and evolution (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 127-135; Brian, M.V., (1977) Ants, , Collins, London; Bridge, A.P., Elwood, R.W., Dick, J.T.A., Imperfect assessment and limited information preclude optimal strategies in male-male fights in the orb-weaving spider Metellina mengei (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 267, pp. 273-279; Briffa, M., Decisions during fights in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus: mutual or self assessment of energy, weapons and size?

We used auditory brainstem responses to tone bursts to assess the auditory sensitivity of Carolina chickadees at frequencies from 0.5 to 8. kHz and the percentage of frequency selectivity (quality) of auditory filters at frequencies from 2 to 4. kHz. The high-frequency limit of sensitive hearing was relatively high in chickadees compared to other songbirds tested using the same method, while the low-frequency limit was similar among species. These results support a previously noted correlation across songbirds between the high-frequency limit of sensitive hearing and the maximum frequency of vocalizations. The frequency selectivity of auditory filters in chickadees increased with increasing frequency. Frequency selectivity was intermediate compared to other species at 2 and 3. kHz, and relatively high at 4. kHz. This pattern suggests that frequency selectivity is generally greatest within the frequency range of long-range communication signals, and maximum frequency selectivity may be greater in woodland species than in open habitat species. Greater frequency selectivity may have evolved for greater frequency resolution of vocal signals, which are relatively tonal in woodland species, or for better signal detection in noise. Finally, males had greater auditory sensitivity than females, whereas females had greater frequency selectivity than males. Greater frequency selectivity may enhance perception of the frequency difference between song notes, which indicates male quality in another chickadee species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Audiogram; Auditory brainstem response (ABR); Auditory filter; Carolina chickadee; Coevolution; Frequency resolution; Frequency selectivity; Notched noise; Poecile carolinensis; Vocal communication","auditory cue; behavioral response; coevolution; filter; frequency analysis; habitat type; noise; perception; resolution; sensitivity analysis; songbird; species diversity; vocalization; woodland; Paridae; Parus carolinensis; Passeri",,,,,,"Badyaev, A.V., Leaf, E.S., Habitat associations of song characteristics in Phylloscopus and Hippolais warblers (1997) Auk, 114, pp. 40-46; Baker, M.C., Gammon, D.E., The gargle call of black-capped chickadees: ontogeny, acoustic structure, population patterns, function, and processes leading to sharing of call characteristics (2007) Ecology and Behavior of Chickadees and Titmice, pp. 167-183. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, K.

However, offspring that have experienced contrasting levels of long-term food intake may beg differently for a given level of short-term need, perhaps as a result of developmental differences in behaviour and/or physiology. We tested for the effects of both short- and long-term need on begging and digestion by manipulating food intake rates of the junior and senior nestlings from broods of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca. Artificial food intake at natural levels created stable and normal levels of begging in both senior and junior nestlings, over 10. h of hand-feeding individuals in isolation. In both classes of nestling, higher than natural levels of food intake led to similar progressive linear declines in begging effort, while lower than natural levels of food intake led to similar progressive increases in begging. However, there were no corresponding changes in digestive efficiency (assimilable mass coefficient). Consistent with previous studies, junior nestlings begged at consistently higher rates throughout compared with senior nestlings. There was also evidence that digestion by junior nestlings was slightly more efficient, but individual variation in begging effort (and change in begging effort) did not correspond to differences in digestive efficiency. These results show that begging does not reflect digestive efficiency across a range of natural food intake rates, and suggest that the honesty of offspring solicitation signals, such as the differences in begging between junior and senior nestlings, are not maintained by contrasting digestive development or function. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Assimilable mass coefficient; Digestive transit time; Feeding rate; Ficedula hypoleuca; Large versus small chicks; Load size; Nutritional need; Offspring solicitation; Pied flycatcher","begging behavior; behavioral ecology; behavioral response; brood size; developmental biology; digestive system; feeding behavior; food intake; hypothesis testing; nestling; parent-offspring interaction; passerine; reproductive effort; signal; Ficedula hypoleuca",,,,,,"Bell, G.P., Morrion, M.L., Ralph, C.J., Verner, J., Jehl, J.R., Birds and mammals on the insect diet: a primer on diet composition analysis in relation to ecological energetics (1990) Studies in Avian Biology, 13, pp. 416-422; Blem, C.R., Energetics of nestling house sparrows Passer domesticus (1975) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, 52 A, pp. 305-312; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Begging in nestling birds (2001) Ibis, 150, pp. 234-241; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Effects of feeding frequency on nestling begging and digestion (2008) Current Ornithology, 16, pp. 83-118; Bulmer, E., Celis, P., Gil, D., Parent-absent begging: evidence for sibling honesty and cooperation in the spotless starling (Sturnus unicolor) (2008) Behavioral Ecology, 19, pp. 279-284; Chappell, M.A., Bachman, G.C., Energetic costs of begging behaviour (2002) The Evolution of Nestling Begging: Competition, Cooperation and Communication, pp. 143-162. , Kluwer Academic Press, New York, J.

Unlike visual and acoustic cues, females rather than males usually emit long-distance chemical signals for mate attraction, thus providing an excellent opportunity to examine male mate choice further. Here, I used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice via chemical cues in a natural scenario. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize in this system, so I predicted strong male mate choice for good-condition females to maximize male reproductive fitness. Results of field-based choice tests showed differential male attraction to good-condition females: all males were found on the cages of good-condition females and none on those of poor-condition females. In a second series of choice tests conducted in large field enclosures, I found that some poor-condition females attracted males in the absence of good-condition females, and that these females had significantly more eggs in their ovaries than the unattractive poor-condition females. Furthermore, when egg number was controlled but female body condition varied, males no longer had a significant preference for good-condition females. I therefore propose that the male preference for fecund females is a result of egg-bearing females producing a greater quantity/quality of pheromone than egg-free females, and that chemical cues are likely to be an honest indicator of female fecundity in this system. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Body condition; Chemical cue; Female nutritional status; Male mate choice; Praying mantid; Pseudomantis albofimbriata","body condition; chemical cue; fecundity; female; fitness; insect; mate attraction; mate choice; mating behavior; nutritional status; paradigm shift; pheromone; reproductive success; Mantidae; Mantodea",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Andersson, M., Simmons, L.W., Sexual selection and mate choice (2006) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 296-302; Bailey, W.J., Mate finding: selection on sensory cues (1991) Reproductive Behaviour of Insects: Individuals and Populations, pp. 42-74. , Chapman & Hall, Melbourne, W.J.

The call is only produced when encountering a higher-ranking group member and has thus been interpreted as a 'greeting' signal. We monitored the calling behaviour of nine adult females in a group of free-ranging chimpanzees, the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda, when encountering higher-ranking adult males. We found that call production was by no means rigid, but that calls were given only if certain social conditions were met. Although all adult males received pant-grunts from females, the alpha male received a significantly larger proportion of calls. The number of pant-grunts given to males was not correlated with their hierarchical position or with the level of anticipated aggression. Instead, females were significantly more likely to vocalize to other males if the alpha male was absent, suggesting that their calling behaviour was moderated by social inhibition. The presence of the alpha female had a similar yet weaker inhibitory effect. Social inhibition was further increased with increasing numbers of bystanders, especially males. Our results thus demonstrate that chimpanzees use their 'greeting' signals flexibly by taking into account the social fabric of their community. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Audience effect; Budongo Forest; Chimpanzee; Dominance; Pan troglodytes; Social awareness; Strategic signalling; Vocal primate cognition","aggression; behavioral ecology; cognition; community structure; dominance; female; group behavior; hierarchical system; hominid; inhibition; inhibitor; signal; vocalization; wild population; Budongo Forest; Uganda; Western Province [Uganda]; Haemulidae; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Primates",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Arbib, M.A., Liebal, K., Pika, S., Primate vocalization, gesture, and the evolution of human language (2008) Current Anthropology, 49, pp. 1053-1076; Arnold, K., Whiten, A., Post-conflict behaviour of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Budongo Forest, Uganda (2001) Behaviour, 138, pp. 649-690; Aureli, F., Schaffner, C., Aggression and conflict management at fusion in spider monkeys (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 147-149; Aureli, F., Schaffner, C.M., Boesch, C., Bearder, S.K., Call, J., Chapman, C.A., Connor, R., van Schaik, C.P., Fission fusion dynamics: new research frameworks (2008) Current Anthropology, 49, pp. 627-654; Barrett, L., Henzi, P., Dunbar, R., Primate cognition: from 'what now?' to 'what if?'

A powerful method for assessing mechanisms of sexual selection is to combine phenotypic manipulation of male sexual traits with manipulation of behavioural interactions associated with sexual selection. We performed such experiments to assess the function of posterior gnathopods (large, sexually dimorphic claws) in mating and reproduction of Hyalella amphipods. Removal of male gnathopods reduced pairing success and shortened pairing duration. Patterns of pairing success were similar in both the absence and presence of competing males, and results were consistent across three species that live in ecologically distinct habitats. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that gnathopods in Hyalella function during the interactions between males and females that lead to pair formation, and such functions are relatively conserved within the Hyalella species complex. Finally, our findings for gnathopod function in Hyalella contrast markedly with a recent study of gnathopod function in another amphipod, Gammarus pulex, indicating that enlarged gnathopods may have diverse functions among mate-guarding amphipod species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Intersexual selection; Intrasexual selection; Sexual dimorphism; Sexual trait","behavioral response; community composition; crustacean; divergence; freshwater environment; functional morphology; habitat type; intersexual interaction; intrasexual interaction; life history trait; phenotype; reproductive success; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; Amphipoda; Crustacea; Gammarus; Gammarus pulex; Hyalella",,,,,,"Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Berglund, A., Bisazza, A., Pilastro, A., Armaments and ornaments: an evolutionary explanation of traits of dual utility (1996) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 58, pp. 385-399; Borowsky, B., The use of the males' gnathopods during precopulation in some gammaridean amphipods (1984) Crustaceana, 47, pp. 245-250; Bousfield, E.L., A contribution to the reclassification of Neotropical freshwater hyalellid amphipods (Crustacea: Gammaridea, Talitroidea) (1996) Bollettino del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Verona, 20, pp. 175-224; Cameron, E., Day, T., Rowe, L., Sexual conflict and indirect benefits (2003) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 16, pp. 1055-1060; Conlan, K.E., Precopulatory mating behaviour and sexual dimorphism in the amphipod Crustacea (1991) Hydrobiologia, 223, pp. 255-282; Cothran, R.D., Phenotypic manipulation reveals sexual conflict over precopula duration (2008) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 62, pp. 1409-1416; Cothran, R.D., The mechanistic basis of a large male mating advantage in two freshwater amphipod species (2008) Ethology, 114, pp. 1145-1153; Darwin, C., (1871) The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, , J.

Several ultimate causes of policing have been proposed, including (1) an increase in colony productivity, applicable if reproductive workers work less, or (2) an increase in worker-to-male relatedness, applicable if within-colony relatedness is low. To explain the distribution of policing across taxa, the explanatory power of these and other potential ultimate causes should be assessed separately. One of the few species for which this can be done is the leafcutter ant Acromyrmex echinatior. We previously demonstrated that colony productivity incentives (and sex ratio incentives) are minimal here, while relatedness incentives are strong because queens are highly multiply mated. Overcoming technical difficulties peculiar to leafcutter ants, we introduced reproductive versus nonreproductive workers and batches of queen-laid versus worker-laid eggs into experimental colony fragments and observed their fate. Our main finding was that workers policed by selectively destroying worker-laid eggs, but without attacking reproductive workers. We infer that relatedness incentives are the most likely ultimate cause of the evolutionary maintenance of worker-egg policing in A. echinatior. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acromyrmex echinatior; Cost of worker reproduction; Leafcutter ant; Multiple queen mating; Reproductive self-restraint; Worker policing","ant; colony; developmental biology; egg; leafminer; population distribution; queen; relatedness; reproductive cost; sex ratio; taxonomy; worker caste; Acromyrmex echinatior; Formicidae; Hymenoptera",,,,,,"Alves, D.A., Imperatriz-Fonseca, V.L., Francoy, T.M., Santos-Filho, P.S., Nogueira-Neto, P., Billen, J., Wenseleers, T., The queen is dead: long live the workers: intraspecific parasitism by workers in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris (2009) Molecular Ecology, 18, pp. 4102-4111; Beekman, M., Good, G., Allsop, M.H., Radloff, S., Pirk, C.W.W., Ratnieks, F.L.W., A non-policing honey bee colony (2002) (Apis mellifera capensis).

To facilitate postcopulatory choice for males of superior genetic quality females are expected to bias precopulatory mate choice towards novel males (i.e. genetically novel sources). Preference for novel partners is also expected to maximize male lifetime reproductive success by allowing males to increase the number of mates. We investigated male and female preference for novel or former mating partners in the spider Pisaura mirabilis by offering females novel males (polyandry) or the same male (monogamy). Precopulatory (mate acceptance) and prefertilization (latency to copulation, mating interruption and copulation duration) behaviours were compared between the two treatments. Males provide females with a nuptial prey gift during courtship. Because of the direct benefit associated with nuptial feeding, females should accept males indiscriminately and exert preference only at the prefertilization level. We found that monogamous females remated more readily than polyandrous females, suggesting less resistance to remating with the same male than with novel mates. No differences in female prefertilization responses were found. Lack of preference for novel mates may suggest that direct selection exerted by the nuptial gift rather than indirect selection for genetic benefits is a more likely driver of female remating propensity. Females were nevertheless resistant to remating, suggesting a trade-off between direct benefits and costs of remating. We found no effect of mate novelty on male mating behaviour, indicating either lack of discriminatory ability or that risk of sperm competition creates paternity benefits from remating with the same female. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Coolidge effect; Direct selection; Genetic benefit; Indirect selection; Mate choice; Material benefit; Nuptial feeding; Nursery web spider; Pisaura mirabilis; Polyandry","behavioral response; competition (ecology); copulation; cost-benefit analysis; feeding behavior; fertilization (reproduction); genetic analysis; mate choice; nuptial gift; parent-offspring interaction; paternity; polyandry; preference behavior; reproductive success; risk factor; sexual selection; spider; trade-off; Araneae; Mirabilis; Pisaura mirabilis; Pisauridae",,,,,,"Andersen, T., Bollerup, K., Toft, S., Bilde, T., Why do males of the spider Pisaura mirabilis wrap their nuptial gifts in silk: female preference or male control?

To address this issue, I examined whether reproductive compatibility is a criterion for maintaining a monogamous pair bond between mates. Prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, are small rodents that form long-term, monogamous pair bonds evidenced by a strong preference for their familiar partners, and thus are an excellent model animal in which to study mate fidelity. Accordingly, I examined partner preferences by male prairie voles and related their behaviour to the reproductive status of their mates. I found that, when given a choice between their familiar female partner and a stranger, male prairie voles differed in their responses depending on the pregnancy status of the partner. Males that were paired with females for 2 weeks displayed mate fidelity only when mating had been initiated within approximately 48. h after pairing. In contrast, males whose mates experienced a delay in the onset of sexual receptivity displayed nonselective affiliative behaviour. I also found that, in addition to being appropriately timed, mating must be successful. Males that mated with ovariectomized females for whom pregnancy was precluded did not display mate fidelity even though mating was initiated within the proper time frame. These observations of mate fidelity only when the partner's pregnancy was sufficiently advanced relative to the duration of the pairing suggest that mating must be both successful and timely. Thus, reproductive compatibility can influence mate fidelity. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Better option; Divorce; Incompatibility; Mate choice; Microtus ochrogaster; Monogamy; Prairie vole; Reproduction","divorce; fertility; incompatibility; mate choice; monogamy; pregnancy; rodent; Animalia; Microtus ochrogaster; Muridae; Rodentia",,,,,,"Aragona, B.J., Wang, Z., The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster): an animal model for behavioral neuroendocrine research on pair bonding (2004) ILAR Journal, 45, pp. 35-45; Bamshad, M., Novak, M.A., De Vries, G.J., Sex and species differences in the vasopressin innervation of sexually naive and parental prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster and meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus (1993) Journal of Neuroendocrinology, 5, pp. 247-255; Bried, J., Pontier, D., Jouventin, P., Mate fidelity in monogamous birds: a re-examination of the Procellariiformes (2003) Animal Behaviour, 65, pp. 235-246; Campbell, J.C., Laugero, K.D., Van Westerhuyzen, J.A., Hostetler, C.M., Cohen, J.D., Bales, K.L., Costs of pair-bonding and paternal care in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (2009) Physiology & Behavior, 98, pp. 367-373; Carter, C.S., Getz, L.L., Monogamy and the prairie vole (1993) Scientific American, 268, pp. 100-106; Carter, C.S., Getz, L.L., Gavish, L., McDermott, J.L., Arnold, P., Male-related pheromones and the activation of female reproduction in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) (1980) Biology of Reproduction, 23, pp. 1038-1045; Carter, C.S., Getz, L.L., Cohen-Parsons, M., Relationships between social organization and behavioral endocrinology in a monogamous mammal (1986) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 16, pp. 109-145; Carter, C.S., Witt, D.M., Auksi, T., Casten, L., Estrogen and the induction of lordosis in female and male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (1987) Hormones and Behavior, 21, pp. 65-73; Carter, C.S., Witt, D.M., Schneider, J., Harris, Z.L., Volkening, D., Male stimuli are necessary for female sexual behavior and uterine growth in prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (1987) Hormones and Behavior, 21, pp. 74-82; Choudhury, S., Divorce in birds: a review of the hypotheses (1995) Animal Behaviour, 50, pp. 413-429; Cohen-Parsons, M., Carter, C.S., Males increase serum estrogen and estrogen receptor binding in brain of female voles (1987) Physiology & Behavior, 39, pp. 309-314; Curtis, J.T., Wang, Z., The neurochemistry of pair bonding (2003) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 12, pp. 49-53; Curtis, J.T., Liu, Y., Wang, Z., Lesions of the vomeronasal organ disrupt mating-induced pair bonding in female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (2001) Brain Research, 901, pp. 167-174; Desy, E.A., Batzli, G.O., Effects of food availability and predation on prairie vole demography: a field experiment (1989) Ecology, 70, pp. 411-421; DeVries, A.C., DeVries, M.B., Taymans, S.E., Carter, C.S., The effects of stress on social preferences are sexually dimorphic in prairie voles (1996) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 93, pp. 11980-11984; Dulac, C., Torello, A.T., Molecular detection of pheromone signals in mammals: from genes to behaviour (2003) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 4, pp. 551-562; Emlen, S.T., Oring, L.W., Ecology, sexual selection, and evolution of mating systems (1977) Science, 197, pp. 215-223; Ens, B.J., Safriel, U.N., Harris, M.P., Divorce in the long-lived and monogamous oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus: incompatibility or choosing the better option (1993) Animal Behaviour, 45, pp. 1199-1217; Ferguson, B., Fuentes, S.M., Sawrey, D.K., Dewsbury, D.A., Male preferences for unmated versus mated females in two species of voles (Microtus ochrogaster and Microtus montanus) (1986) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 100, pp. 243-247; Ferkin, M.H., Johnston, R.E., Effects of pregnancy, lactation and postpartum estrus on odor signals and the attraction to odors in female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1211-1217; Ferkin, M.H., Combs, A., delBarco-Trillo, J., Pierce, A.A., Franklin, S., Meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, have the capacity to recall the "" what"" , "" where"" , and "" when"" of a single past event (2008) Animal Cognition, 11, pp. 147-159; Gavish, L., Carter, C.S., Getz, L.L., Further evidences for monogamy in the prairie vole (1981) Animal Behaviour, 29, pp. 955-957; Getz, L.L., Hofmann, J.E., Social organization in free-living prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster (1986) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 18, pp. 275-282; Getz, L.L., Simms, L.E., McGuire, B., Snarski, M.E., Factors affecting life expectancy of the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster (1997) Oikos, 80, pp. 362-370; Getz, L.L., McGuire, B., Pizzuto, T., Does mate choice take place in free-living prairie voles Microtus ochrogaster?

In spring, parasitic females awaken from hibernation and start searching for established host nests. Some Psithyrus species are specialized on one host species, whereas generalists parasitize several species. In previous investigations, nest-marking signals of the bumblebee hosts have been shown to play a role in host recognition and discrimination between host and nonhost. We performed behavioural experiments and comparative chemical analyses with the specialist Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis and the generalist Bombus (Psithyrus) bohemicus to identify semiochemicals that the females use to recognize the common host, Bombus terrestris. In chemical analyses of footprint samples, we mainly identified nonpolar hydrocarbons and polar wax-type esters. Bioassays with nonpolar and polar fractions obtained by solid phase extraction indicate that specialized parasites use a complex bouquet of compounds for host recognition, whereas generalists need only selected substances common to the signals of all of their hosts. The evolutionary significance of the results is discussed. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Chemical analysis; Cuckoo bumblebee; Ester; Footprint cue; Fractionation; Generalist; Host nest recognition; Hydrocarbon; Odour composition; Specialist","bee; bioassay; chemical analysis; chemical cue; colony; ester; evolutionary biology; footprint; fractionation; generalist; hibernation; host location; hydrocarbon; odor; signal; social parasitism; specialist; Bombus bohemicus; Bombus terrestris; Bombus vestalis; Psithyrus",,,,,,"Ayasse, M., Odor based interindividual and nest recognition in the sweat bee Lasioglossum malachurum (1990) Social Insects and the Environment, pp. 511-512. , Oxford & IBH, New Delhi, G.K.

Consequently the functions of female calls are not as well understood as those produced by males. We investigated a novel female call produced during mating in the Emei music frog. The functions of the female call during reproductive behaviours were evaluated by field and seminatural playback experiments. During mating, low-intensity female calls (approximately 3.2. s in duration) alternated with male sexual movements (approximately 1.34. s in duration). Female calling was sometimes prolonged when we interrupted male movements, which is consistent with the idea that female calls may stimulate male sexual activity and perhaps facilitate ovulation. In their natural environment, Babina males vocalize and mate in well-hidden underground nests. Field playback experiments showed that female calls significantly increased the rate of male advertisement calling which may help females locate males. Males also showed significant positive phonotactic responses to playback of female calls, and increased aggressive call production and other aggressive behaviours which females may use as cues for mate selection. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Advertisement call; Aggressive call; Babina daunchina; Emei music frog; Female call; Mate recognition; Nest; Phonotaxis","aggression; calling behavior; frog; mate recognition; nest; sexual behavior; Anura",,,,,,"Bosch, J., Female reciprocal calling in the Iberian midwife toad (Alytes cisternasii) varies with male call rate and dominant frequency: implications for sexual selection (2001) Naturwissenschaften, 88, pp. 434-437; Bosch, J., The functionality of female reciprocal calls in the Iberian midwife toad (Alytes cisternasii): female-female acoustic competition?

Their ability to discriminate among individual alarm callers and to identify the location of those callers may allow receivers to track predator movement from acoustic information in multiple-caller bouts. Observations of encounters with live terrestrial and avian predators revealed that squirrels were significantly more likely to produce a multiple-caller bout that tracked predator movement when avian predators were airborne than when predators remained on the ground. To test whether receivers perceived such differences, squirrels were presented with playbacks of multiple-caller bouts composed of either chirps (commonly issued in response to airborne predators), or whistles (commonly issued in response to predators on the ground) from callers that were either unfamiliar or familiar to the receiver. In response to unfamiliar chirps, but not unfamiliar whistles, receivers were significantly more vigilant when call bouts progressively increased in proximity than when call bouts progressively decreased in proximity. Thus, Richardson's ground squirrels use multiple alarm callers to track airborne avian but not terrestrial predators, presumably owing to the more immediate threat that airborne predators pose, but also because of the relative paucity of directional information in bouts of whistle calls associated with potential threats on the ground. Squirrels were more responsive to calls from familiar neighbours, however, and despite our relatively small sample of familiar caller playbacks, receivers showed limited evidence of differential response to approaching versus receding bouts of whistle calls when they were familiar with callers. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alarm calling; Communication network; Indirect detection; Richardson's ground squirrel; Sciuridae; Sociality; Spermophilus richardsonii","alarm signal; conspecific; movement; play; predator; rodent; vocalization; Animalia; Aves; Sciuridae; Spermophilus; Spermophilus richardsonii",,,,,,"Guidelines for the treatment of animals in behavioural research and teaching (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 2-1016. , ASAB/ABS; Beauchamp, G., Ruxton, G.D., False alarms and the evolution of antipredator vigilance (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 1199-1206; Blumstein, D.T., Golden-marmot alarm calls.

We investigated the functions of vigilance behaviour in wild spotted hyaenas. These large carnivores have few predators but face frequent threats of attack and food theft by conspecifics. We made repeated observations of vigilance behaviour by hyaenas when they were resting, feeding and nursing, and examined variation due to age, group size, social rank, and factors related to predation risk. We used these observations to test whether vigilance functions in hyaenas to detect prey, mates, conspecific threats or interspecific threats, and whether functions differ between juveniles and adults. We found that adults were more vigilant than juveniles in all contexts. Vigilance by adults was greatest when nursing, but nursing females reduced their vigilance as cubs matured. Among both age groups, vigilance decreased with increasing group size, and hyaenas were less vigilant when feeding on high-quality food than when feeding on low-quality food. Social rank did not affect vigilance in either age group. Individual adults, but not juveniles, showed consistent patterns of vigilance within, but not between, behavioural contexts. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the primary function of vigilance in hyaenas is to detect interspecific threats. Furthermore, vigilance was context specific, and adult hyaenas showed individual variation in vigilance within behavioural contexts. These findings illustrate the relative importance of particular risks in shaping vigilance behaviour of a top carnivore. © 2010.","Antipredator behaviour; Crocuta crocuta; East Africa; Group-size effect; Hyaena; Hyena; Individual differences; Social vigilance","adult; age; carnivore; conspecific; decision making; food quality; group size; individual variation; predation risk; predator; vigilance; East Africa; Crocuta crocuta; Hyaena",,,,,,"Alados, C.L., An analysis of vigilance in the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) (1985) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 68, pp. 58-64; Alberts, S.C., Vigilance in young baboons: effects of habitat, age, sex and maternal rank on glance rate (1994) Animal Behaviour, 47, pp. 749-755; Arenz, C.L., The group size effect on vigilance: many unanswered questions (2003) Behavioural Processes, 63, pp. 123-124; Arenz, C.L., Leger, D.W., The antipredator vigilance of adult and juvenile thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Sciuridae: Spermophilus tridecemlineatus): visual obstruction and simulated hawk attacks (1997) Ethology, 103, pp. 945-953; Arenz, C.L., Leger, D.W., Thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Sciuridae: Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) antipredator vigilance decreases as vigilance cost increases (1999) Animal Behaviour, 57, pp. 97-103; Arenz, C.L., Leger, D.W., Antipredator vigilance of juvenile and adult thirteen-lined ground squirrels and the role of nutritional need (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 535-541; Atwood, T.C., Gese, E.M., Coyotes and recolonizing wolves: social rank mediates risk-conditional behaviour at ungulate carcasses (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 753-762; Avilés, J.S., Bednekoff, P.A., How do vigilance and feeding by common cranes Grus grus depend on age, habitat, and flock size?

Several hypotheses have been proposed to suggest that individuals may benefit from caching even when cache pilferage is high if all individuals can cache and pilfer equally. Stable groups may hypothetically support the evolution of such 'reciprocal pilfering' because all group members may potentially have numerous opportunities to pilfer each other's caches. If that were the case, then we would expect animals to cache openly in front of their group members, but to avoid caching in direct view of unknown conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis by allowing mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, to cache food in three experimental conditions: (1) with a familiar observer from the same group and an unfamiliar conspecific observer; (2) with a familiar observer from the same group only and (3) without any observers. When presented with both a familiar and an unfamiliar observer, the caching chickadees treated both observers equally by choosing caching sites that were both farther away and out of sight of both observers. When only the familiar observer was present, chickadees shifted their choice of caching sites to the surfaces both away from and out of sight of the observer. When no observers were present, all available caching sites were used equally. Our results thus do not support the reciprocal cache sharing hypothesis and suggest that chickadees try to minimize cache pilferage from both familiar group members and unfamiliar conspecifics. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cache pilferage; Cache pilferage prevention; Chickadee; Food caching","caching; conspecific; food selection; group behavior; songbird; Animalia; Paridae; Parus gambeli; Poecile gambeli",,,,,,"Andersson, M., Krebs, J.R., On the evolution of hoarding behaviour (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 707-711; Baker, M.C., Anderson, P., Once-pilfered cache sites not avoided by black-capped chickadees (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1599-1602; Baker, M.C., Stone, E., Miller Baker, A.E., Shelden, R.J., Skillicorn, P., Mantych, M.D., Evidence against observational learning in storage and recovery of seeds by black-capped chickadees (1988) Auk, 105, pp. 492-497; Baker, M.C., Mantych, M.D., Shelden, R.J., Social dominance, food caching and recovery by black-capped chickadees Parus atricapillus: is there a cheater strategy?

However, feeding in a high wind environment presents the challenge of interpreting the movements of many stimuli, most of which convey little information pertinent to survival. A bird that responds to each of these wind-driven movements would likely suffer the loss of much feeding time. Birds should thus become less responsive to moving stimuli at greater wind speeds. Furthermore, since inanimate objects should not move upwind, birds should generally be more responsive to upwind movements than typical downwind movements. By exposing passerine flocks to a moving, potentially threatening stimulus at various wind speeds, we found that these birds are in fact less responsive to stimulus movement (i.e. a lower tendency to flush to cover) as wind speed increases. However, birds were not more responsive to upwind movements of the stimulus. The propensity to flush was also not significantly affected by temperature or flock size. Responsiveness tended to decline over time, possibly indicating habituation to the stimulus, but the basic effect of wind speed held over the entire study. The general effect of wind on responsiveness suggests that the likelihood of responding to other stimuli or disturbances on windy days may also be reduced. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Antipredator behaviour; Flight response; Passerine flock; Stimulus movement; Wind","antipredator defense; bird; flight; foraging behavior; habituation; movement; passerine; survival; visual cue; wind velocity; Aves; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Bakken, G.S., Murphy, M.T., Erskine, D.J., The effect of wind and air temperature on metabolism and evaporative water loss rates of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis: a standard operative temperature scale (1991) Physiological Zoology, 64, pp. 1023-1049; Beauchamp, G., Determinants of false alarms in staging flocks of semipalmated sandpipers (2010) Behavioral Ecology, 21, pp. 584-587; Beauchamp, G., Ruxton, G.D., False alarms and the evolution of antipredator vigilance (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 1199-1206; Blumstein, D.T., Flight-initiation distance in birds is dependent on intruder starting distance (2003) Journal of Wildlife Management, 67, pp. 852-857; Boysen, A.F., Lima, S.L., Bakken, G.S., Does the thermal environment influence vigilance behavior in dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis)?

In five experiments, we gave 10 monkeys from one wild group of bearded capuchins a choice of two nuts differing in resistance and size and/or two manufactured stones of the same shape, volume and composition but different mass. Monkeys consistently selected the nut that was easier to crack and the heavier stone. When choosing between two stones differing in mass by a ratio of 1.3:1, monkeys frequently touched the stones or tapped them with their fingers or with a nut. They showed these behaviours more frequently before making their first selection of a stone than afterward. These results suggest that capuchins discriminate between nuts and between stones, selecting materials that allow them to crack nuts with fewer strikes, and generate exploratory behaviours to discriminate stones of varying mass. In the final experiment, humans effectively discriminated the mass of stones using the same tapping and handling behaviours as capuchins. Capuchins explore objects in ways that allow them to perceive invariant properties (e.g. mass) of objects, enabling selection of objects for specific uses. We predict that species that use tools will generate behaviours that reveal invariant properties of objects such as mass; species that do not use tools are less likely to explore objects in this way. The precision with which individuals can judge invariant properties may differ considerably, and this also should predict prevalence of tool use across species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Decision making; Exploratory behaviour; Hammer stone; Haptics; Mass; Nut; Optimization; Perception; Perceptual learning; Tool use","decision making; learning; mass; nut; optimization; perception; precision; primate; tool use; Cebidae; Cebus; Cebus libidinosus",,,,,,"Altmann, S.A., (1998) Foraging for Survival: Yearling Baboons in Africa, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Amazeen, E.L., Turvey, M.T., Weight perception and the haptic size-weight illusion are functions of the inertia tensor (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 22, pp. 213-232; Aumann, T., Use of stones by the black-breasted buzzard Hamirostra melanosternon to gain access to egg contents for food (1990) Emu, 90, pp. 141-144; Boesch, C., Boesch, H., Optimisation of nut-cracking with natural hammers by wild chimpanzees (1983) Behaviour, 83, pp. 265-286; Brockmann, H.J., Barnard, C.J., Kleptoparasitism in birds (1979) Animal Behaviour, 27, pp. 487-514; Broom, M., Ruxton, G.D., Evolutionarily stable kleptoparasitism: consequences of different prey types (2003) Behavioral Ecology, 14, pp. 23-33; Burton, G., Non-neural extensions of haptic sensitivity (1993) Ecological Psychology, 5, pp. 105-124; Carbone, C., DuToit, J.T., Gordon, I.J., Feeding success in African wild dogs: does kleptoparasitism by spotted hyenas influence hunting group size?

The strength and the time of onset of this recognition process depend on ecological factors that constrain parental care. For instance, parent-offspring recognition generally appears earlier in nidifugous than in nidicolous species. We investigated whether fledglings in a nidicolous species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, recognize their parents and the fate of this recognition process once the parents had stopped their food provisioning. Zebra finches are gregarious passerines that provide parental care to chicks up to 20 days after fledging. In playback experiments, fledglings preferentially responded to parental calls over other adult calls and thus recognized both their father's and mother's distance calls. However, at 2 months, motivation to respond to parental and other adult calls became sex specific, with sons no longer reacting preferentially to their father's calls, whereas daughters did. This pattern may be linked to the development of sexual traits and mate-searching behaviours. The persistence of parent recognition at the age of pair formation may also be of critical importance during mate choice. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acoustic communication; Individual signature; Long-term memory; Parent-offspring recognition; Postfledging care; Sex difference; Taeniopygia guttata; Vocal recognition; Zebra finch","alarm signal; auditory cue; conspecific; familiarity; fledging; juvenile; mate choice; memory; parent-offspring interaction; parental care; sex-related difference; songbird; vocalization; Aves; Taeniopygia guttata",,,,,,"Adret, P., Operant conditioning, song learning and imprinting to taped song in the zebra finch (1993) Animal Behaviour, 46, pp. 149-159; Aubin, T., Jouventin, P., How to identify vocally a kin in a crowd?

Although individuals witnessing a conflict are not directly threatened by aggressive interactions, the aftermath of aggression appears to be a period of social instability. We expected bystanders to respond to conflicts by affiliating with other group members and so reducing social tension. To test this hypothesis we collected data on two captive groups of Tonkean macaques, Macaca tonkeana. After an agonistic interaction, the behaviours of focal individuals uninvolved in the conflict were recorded over 5. min postconflict periods, for comparison with baseline periods. The results showed that bystanders were more likely to show affiliation during postconflict periods than in baselines. We found that affiliation occurred more frequently between individuals linked by friendship, whereas no significant effect of kinship appeared, which may be related to the open social relationships reported in Tonkean macaques. Females initiated affiliation sooner than males and conflicts involving physical contact were more quickly followed by affiliation between bystanders. Rates of scratching tended to decrease after the first affiliative interaction. None the less, few signs of anxiety were observed in bystanders. Our results reflect the high propensity of Tonkean macaques to appease others and stop aggression. This study demonstrates that postconflict affiliation occurs between bystanders in a species characterized by tolerant social relationships. It could be a pervasive means of social cohesion among primates. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Appeasement; Macaca tonkeana; Polyadic interaction; Primate; Social tension; Tonkean macaque","aggression; group behavior; intraspecific interaction; kinship; primate; Macaca; Macaca tonkeana; Primates",,,,,,"Abegglen, J.J., (1984) On Socialization in Hamadryas Baboon, , Bucknell University Press, Lewisburg; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-265; Arnold, K., Aureli, F., Postconflict reconciliation (2007) Primates in Perspective, pp. 592-608. , Oxford University Press, New York, C.J.

However, growing evidence suggests that male choosiness is more common than expected. While male mate choice is clearly linked to high mating investment in sex role-reversed species, factors promoting male mate choice in conventional sex role species are still debated. We addressed this fundamental issue in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), a group-living species where members of both sexes exercise mutual mate choice to avoid inbreeding. We focused on (1) male potential reproductive rate, (2) male effective reproductive rate, and (3) male reproductive success in relation to female quality. Males tested in situations with unrestrained female availability were able to mate throughout their life, thus revealing a high potential reproductive rate. However, their effective reproductive rate was much more limited under ecologically realistic conditions with restrained female availability. In contradiction with general predictions of sex role theory, mate choice by B. germanica males occurs despite an apparent low mating investment and a male-biased operational sex ratio. The finding that inbred matings were less fertile than outbred matings reveals that kinship is the key factor promoting male choice in this particular case. In the light of inbreeding avoidance theory, we propose that by being choosy cockroach males avoid imposing inbreeding costs on their sisters, thus maximizing their own inclusive fitness via kin selection. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Blattella germanica; German cockroach; Inbreeding avoidance; Kin selection; Male mate choice; Sex role","cockroach; inbreeding avoidance; inclusive fitness; kin recognition; kinship; male; mate choice; reproductive success; sex ratio; sex role; Blattaria; Blattella germanica",,,,,,"Amundsen, T., Forsgren, E., Male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 98, pp. 13155-13160; Anderson, W.W., Kim, Y.K., Gowaty, P.A., Experimental constraints on mate preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura decrease offspring viability and fitness of mated pairs (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 104, pp. 4484-4488; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bateman, M., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Bateson, P.P.G., Optimal outbreeding (1983) Mate Choice, pp. 257-277. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, P.P.G.

We conducted field studies to identify the mating tactics used by P. fructifera males and to determine whether factors such as male body size and available resource flowers contribute to variation in male mating tactic. Males in a population in southern Brazil showed pronounced variation in body size, but no distinct size classes. Larger males aggressively defended territories of flowering Opuntia plants, the sole pollen source for the females. Smaller males nonaggressively patrolled nonflowering shrubs growing between the nest aggregation and patches of Opuntia. Only unmated females were attractive to males. When offered to males in patrolled shrubs, up to eight males attempted to mate with the same female, but in territories only the territory owner mated with the introduced female. About 10. min after mating, females were unattractive to males. These results identify the species as monogamous and indicate that territoriality is an adaptive mating tactic. Experimental addition of Opuntia flowers to patrolled shrubs showed that nonterritorial males can switch to territorial behaviour. Thus, the number of available flowers together with the number of competitor males determines the ratio of territorial males to patrolling males at a given site. The experiment shows that male P. fructifera show a conditional reproductive strategy in which males adopt alternative tactics according to their size. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Alternative mating tactic; Conditional reproductive strategy; Emphorini; Oligolecty; Solitary bee","aggregation behavior; aggression; bee; body size; cactus; field survey; male; mate attraction; nest structure; patch size; pollen; population distribution; reproductive strategy; shrub; territoriality; territory; Brazil; Apidae; Apoidea; Cactaceae; Emphorini; Hymenoptera; Opuntia; Ptilothrix (bee)",,,,,,"Aguiar, C.M.L., Martins, C.F., Fenologia e preferência alimentar de Ceblurgus longipalpis Urban Moure, 1993 (Hymenoptera, Halictidae, Dufoureinae) (1994) Revista Nordestina de Biologia, 9, pp. 125-131; Alcock, J., Natural selection and the mating systems of solitary bees (1980) American Scientist, 68, pp. 146-153; Alcock, J., Mating systems and male size in Australian hylaeine bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) (1996) Ethology, 102, pp. 591-610; Alcock, J., Provisional rejection of three alternative hypotheses on the maintenance of a size dichotomy in males of Dawson's burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni (Apidae, Apinae, Anthophorini) (1996) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 39, pp. 181-188; Alcock, J., Competition from large males and the alternative mating tactics of Dawson's burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni (Apidae, Apinae, Anthophorini) (1997) Journal of Insect Behavior, 10, pp. 99-113; Alcock, J., O'Neill, K.M., Density-dependent mating tactics in the grey hairstreak, Strymon melinus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) (1986) Journal of Zoology, 209, pp. 105-113; Alcock, J., Eickwort, G.C., Eickwort, K.R., The reproductive behavior of Anthidium maculosum (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) and the evolutionary significance of multiple copulation by females (1977) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 2, pp. 385-396; Alcock, J., Jones, C.E., Buchmann, S.L., Male mating strategies in the bee Centris pallida Fox (Anthophoridae: Hymenoptera) (1977) American Naturalist, 111, pp. 146-165; Alves-dos-Santos, I., Machos de abelhas oligoléticas como polinizadores eficientes (2002) Anais do Encontro sobre Abelhas, 5, pp. 136-140; Bergman, P., Bergström, G., Scent marking, scent origin, and species specificity in male premating behavior of two Scandinavian bumblebees (1997) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 23, pp. 1235-1251; Bergman, P., Bergström, G., Appelgren, M., Labial gland marking secretion in males of two Scandinavian cuckoo bumblebee species (genus Psithyrus) (1996) Chemoecology, 7, pp. 140-145; Bergström, G., Bergman, P., Appelgren, M., Schmidt, J.O., Labial gland chemistry of three species of bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) from North America (1996) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 4, pp. 515-519; Borgia, G., Sexual competition in Scatophaga stercoraria: size and density-related changes in male ability to capture females (1980) Behaviour, 75, pp. 185-206; Bosch, J., Vicens, N., Body size as an estimator of production costs in a solitary bee (2002) Ecological Entomology, 27, pp. 129-137; Bullock, S.H., Relationships among body size, wing size and mass in bees from a tropical dry forest in Mexico (1999) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 72, pp. 426-439; Cane, J.H., Estimation of bee size using intertegular span (Apoidea) (1987) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 60, pp. 145-147; Calsbeek, R., Marnocha, E., Context dependent territory defense: the importance of habitat structure in Anolis sagrei (2006) Ethology, 112, pp. 537-543; Calsbeek, R., Sinervo, B., The ontogeny of territoriality during maturation (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 468-477; Convey, P., Influences on the choice between territorial and satellite behaviour in male Libellula quadrimaculata Linn.

Sexual behaviour of these herbivores is integrated in several ways with host plants, as the latter influence timing and location of reproduction, and can provide clues for finding mates. Nevertheless, while numerous studies link butterfly evolution to host plant adaptations, the influence of plants on butterfly sexual behaviour has been little studied. We conducted experiments to determine the role of host plant cues in mate-searching behaviour of Heliconius charithonia butterflies. This species exhibits precopulatory mate guarding behaviour, wherein males find and perch on pupae, then copulate with eclosing females ('pupal mating'). We found that males (1) visited plants damaged by feeding larvae more often than they visited undamaged plants and (2) displayed searching behaviour around the plant and in front of larvae, suggesting that odours signal the location of potential partners (pupae). Although males were attracted to common plant odours released after tissue damage, plants damaged by heterospecific butterfly larvae were less attractive, indicating that species recognition can occur at early life stages. Overall, our results suggest that host plants influence mate-searching behaviour of Heliconius. This might also be true for other species of butterflies with more conventional mating strategies, potentially contributing to the diversification of this group of phytophagous insects. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Butterfly; Heliconius; Host fidelity; Host plant; Male mate searching; Plant volatile; Pupal mating; Sexual behaviour","butterfly; host plant; host-parasite interaction; larva; mate guarding; phytochemistry; plant defense; pupa; reproductive strategy; Heliconius; Heliconius charithonia; Hexapoda; Papilionoidea",,,,,,"Andersson, S., Dobson, H.E.M., Behavioral foraging responses by the butterfly Heliconius melpomene to Lantana camara floral scent (2003) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 29, pp. 2303-2318; Beccaloni, G.W., Viloria, A.L., Hall, S.K., Robinson, G.S., (2008) Catalogue of the Hostplants of the Neotropical Butterflies, , Sociedad Entomológica Aragonesa, Zaragoza; Bell, W.J., Searching behavior patterns in insects (1990) Annual Review of Entomology, 35, pp. 447-467; Beltrán, M., Jiggins, C.D., Brower, A.V.Z., Bermingham, E., Mallet, J.L.B., Do pollen feeding, pupal mating and larval gregariousness have a single origin in Heliconius butterflies?

Antiparasite defence behaviour is costly in terms of time, energy and/or food foregone and therefore animals are expected to modulate their defences depending on the risk of attack and/or the severity of the symptoms caused. We tested the hypothesis that an insect host invests more in defence against more virulent (more likely to cause death) than less virulent parasites. We tested avoidance and grooming of adult pine weevils, Hylobius abietis, in response to infective juveniles of two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, the more virulent Steinernema carpocapsae and less virulent Heterorhabditis downesi. Weevils avoided feeding on a substrate contaminated with S. carpocapsae but not H. downesi. Weevils also groomed more when their bodies were contaminated with S. carpocapsae than either H. downesi or water. We also made direct observations of nematodes on weevils. When equal numbers of nematodes were applied to weevils more S. carpocapsae than H. downesi moved actively on the weevil's cuticle. Thus, the differential response of weevils to the two nematode species can be explained by the weevils detecting the more aggressive behaviour of S. carpocapsae than H. downesi, which corresponds to a higher probability of death. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Antiparasite defence; Entomopathogenic nematode; Grooming; Heterorhabditis downesi; Hylobius abietis; Large pine weevil; Parasite avoidance; Parasite recognition; Steinernema carpocapsae","aggression; antiparasite defense; avoidance reaction; beetle; cause of death; defense behavior; entomopathogenic organism; grooming; nematode; risk factor; substrate; virulence; Animalia; Curculionidae; Heterorhabditis downesi; Hexapoda; Hylobius abietis; Nematoda; Steinernema carpocapsae",,,,,,"Appel, A.G., Benson, E.P., Ellenberger, J.M., Manweiler, S.A., Laboratory and field evaluations of an entomopathogenic nematode (Nematoda: Steinernematidae) for German cockroach (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae) control (1993) Journal of Economic Entomology, 86, pp. 777-784; Baker, R.L., Smith, B.P., Conflict between antipredator and antiparasite behaviour in larval damselflies (1997) Oecologia, 109, pp. 622-628; Boecking, O., Spivak, M., Behavioral defenses of honey bees against Varroa jacobsoni Oud (1999) Apidologie, 30, pp. 141-158; Burnell, A.M., Stock, S.P., Heterorhabditis, Steinernema and their bacterial symbionts: lethal pathogens of insects (1999) Nematology, 2, pp. 31-42; Campbell, J.F., Gaugler, R., Nictation behaviour and its ecological implications in the host search strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) (1993) Behaviour, 126, pp. 155-169; Campbell, J.F., Gaugler, R., Inter-specific variation in entomopathogenic nematode foraging strategy: dichotomy or variation along a continuum?

Much of the evidence for pursuit deterrence is indirect in that signalling is not shown to reduce probability of attack. Indirect evidence is obtained by eliminating alternative hypotheses and demonstrating that signals are directed to predators. Other studies have shown that signalling is related to single predation risk factors. Because prey need not signal at low risk and should attempt to escape immediately when at high risk, pursuit-deterrent signals should occur most frequently at intermediate risk. Tests of escape theory have demonstrated that flight initiation distance (predator-prey distance when prey flees) increases as risk associated with various risk factors increases. I show that in the lizard Callisaurus draconoides, which signals by waving its tail, probability and timing of signalling are affected by degree of risk for several factors that strongly affect flight initiation distance, specifically distance to refuge, speed and directness of approach, and predator persistence. Flight initiation distance increased with risk for all factors, but for all but one factor, relationships to risk differed between signalling and escape, and differences were readily predicted from functional differences between these behaviours. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal communication; Approach speed; Distance fled; Escape behaviour; Flight; Initiation distance; Predation risk; Pursuit deterrence; Refuge distance; Squamata","escape behavior; flight behavior; lizard; persistence; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; refuge; risk factor; signaling; Animalia; Callisaurus draconoides; Squamata",,,,,,"Bergstrom, C.T., Lachmann, M., Alarm calls as costly signals of antipredator vigilance: the watchful babbler game (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 535-543; Blumstein, D.T., Flight-initiation distance in birds is dependent on intruder starting distance (2003) Journal of Wildlife Management, 67, pp. 852-857; Bulova, S.J., Ecological correlates of population and individual variation in antipredator behavior of two species of desert lizards (1994) Copeia, 1994, pp. 980-992; Caro, T.M., The functions of stotting in Thomson's gazelles: some tests of the predictions (1986) Animal Behaviour, 34, pp. 663-684; Caro, T.M., (2005) Antipredator Defenses in Birds and Mammals, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Caro, T.M., Lombardo, L., Goldizen, A.W., Kelly, M., Tail-flagging and other antipredator signals in white-tailed deer: new data and synthesis (1995) Behavioral Ecology, 6, pp. 442-450; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159; Cooper, W.E., Threat factors affecting antipredatory behavior in the broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps): repeated approach, change in predator path, and predator's field of view (1997) Copeia, 1997, pp. 613-619; Cooper, W.E., Multiple roles of tail display by the curly-tailed lizard Leiocephalus carinatus: pursuit deterrent and deflective roles of a social signal (2001) Ethology, 107, pp. 1137-1149; Cooper, W.E., Dynamic risk assessment: prey rapidly adjust flight initiation distance to changes in predator approach speed (2006) Ethology, 112, pp. 858-864; Cooper, W.E., Escape and its relationship to pursuit-deterrent signalling in the Cuban curly-tailed lizard Leiocephalus carinatus (2007) Herpetologica, 63, pp. 144-150; Cooper, W.E., Visual monitoring of predators: occurrence, cost and benefit for escape (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1365-1372; Cooper, W.E., Optimal escape theory predicts escape behaviors beyond flight initiation distance: risk assessment and escape by striped plateau lizards Sceloporus virgatus (2009) Current Zoology, 55, pp. 123-131; Cooper, W.E., Fleeing and hiding under simultaneous risks and costs (2009) Behavioral Ecology, 20, pp. 665-671; Cooper, W.E., Frederick, W.G., Optimal flight initiation distance (2007) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 244, pp. 59-67; Cooper, W.E., Frederick, W.G., Predator lethality, optimal escape behavior, and autotomy (2010) Behavioral Ecology, 21, pp. 91-96; Cooper, W.E., Whiting, M.J., Universal optimization of flight initiation distance and habitat-driven variation in escape tactics in a Namibian lizard assemblage (2007) Ethology, 113, pp. 661-672; Cooper, W.E., Perez-Mellado, V., Baird, T.A., Caldwell, J.P., Vitt, L.J., Pursuit deterrent signalling by the Bonaire whiptail lizard Cnemidophorus murinus (2004) Behaviour, 141, pp. 297-311; Cooper, W.E., Hawlena, D., Pérez-Mellado, V., Interactive effect of starting distance and approach speed on escape behaviour challenges theory (2009) Behavioral Ecology, 20, pp. 542-546; Cresswell, W., Song as a pursuit-deterrent signal, and its occurrence relative to other anti-predation behaviours of skylark (Alauda arvensis) on attack by merlins (Falco columbarius) (1994) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 34, pp. 217-223; Dial, B.E., Tail display in two species of iguanid lizards: a test of the "" predator signal"" hypothesis (1986) American Naturalist, 127, pp. 103-111; FitzGibbon, C.D., Fanshawe, J.H., Stotting in Thomson's gazelles (1988) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 23, pp. 69-74; Gliner, J.A., George, A.M., Harmon, R.J., The chi-square test and accompanying effect size indices (2002) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 41, pp. 1510-1512; Hasson, O., Hibbard, R., Ceballos, G., The pursuit deterrent function of tail-wagging in the zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides) (1989) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 67, pp. 1203-1209; Hemmi, J.M., Merkle, T., High stimulus specificity characterizes anti-predator habituation under natural conditions (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 276, pp. 4381-4388; Holley, A.J.F., Do brown hares signal foxes?

However, the contribution of intraspecific variation in behaviours, especially between sexes, remains less understood. We explored resource preference and resource use by male and female Manduca sexta hawkmoths, relative to two important nectar resources in southern Arizona, U.S.A. Manduca sexta is the major pollinator of one of these species (Datura wrightii, Solanaceae). Because females must also seek out D. wrightii as an oviposition resource, females were predicted to feed upon it more than would males, which should be free to choose the best nectar resource. Using naïve laboratory-reared moths in flight arena experiments, we found that both sexes preferred Datura wrightii over Agave palmeri (Agavaceae). Exposure to only one species and an odourless paper control, however, revealed sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour, with females feeding longer from A. palmeri and males feeding longer from D. wrightii, leading us to reject our hypothesis. Differences in feeding preferences directly translated into differences in energy intake. Females gained significantly more energy than did males by feeding from A. palmeri. We also examined whether behavioural preferences of moths in the laboratory translated into foraging behaviour in the field. Pollen load analysis of moths caught in 2004 showed that females carried significantly more A. palmeri pollen than did males, whereas males carried more D. wrightii pollen than did females. Whereas most studies examine pollination associations at the species level, our results highlight the potential importance of between-sex variation in floral visits. © 2010.","Agave palmeri; Datura wrightii; Hawkmoth foraging behaviour; Manduca sexta; Pollen load analysis; Pollination; Sex-specific behaviour","dicotyledon; floral trait; foraging behavior; intraspecific variation; monocotyledon; moth; nectar; oviposition; palynology; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; resource use; sex-related difference; Arizona; United States; Agavaceae; Agave; Agave palmeri; Datura; Datura wrightii; Lepidoptera; Magnoliophyta; Manduca sexta; Solanaceae; Sphingidae",,,,,,"Alarcón, R., Bronstein, J.L., Davidowitz, G., Nectar usage in a southern Arizona hawkmoth community (2008) Ecological Entomology, 33, pp. 503-509; Alarcón, R., Waser, N.M., Ollerton, J., Year-to-year variation in the topology of a plant-pollinator interaction network (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 1796-1807; Bartholomew, G.A., Casey, T.M., Oxygen consumption of moths during rest, pre-flight warm-up, and flight relation to body size and wing morphology (1978) Journal of Experimental Biology, 76, pp. 11-25; Bell, R.A., Joachim, F.G., Techniques for rearing laboratory colonies of tobacco hornworms and pink bollworms (1976) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 69, pp. 365-373; Bowers, J.E., Dimmitt, M.A., Flowering phenology of six woody plants in the northern Sonoran Desert (1994) Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 121, pp. 215-229; Bronstein, J.L., Huxman, T.E., Davidowitz, G., Plant-mediated effects linking herbivory and pollination (2007) Ecological Communities: Plant Mediation in Indirect Interaction Webs, pp. 79-103. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, T.

Although the costs of repeated signals have been investigated by the postfight analysis of metabolites, single physiological measures may not adequately reflect an individual's overall stamina. An alternative approach is to investigate whole-organism performance capacities. We examined the relationship between locomotor capacities and the vigour of repeated bouts of shell-rapping signals during fights over gastropod shells in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. In these fights only attacking crabs perform shell rapping while defenders withdraw into their shell. Successful attackers and defenders had higher mean and maximum walking speeds than losers. Furthermore, maximum speed was a better correlate of fighting ability in defenders, whereas mean speed was better in attackers. This study demonstrates that whole-organism performance capacities correlate with success in agonistic encounters, and that different aspects of performance capacity appear to be important depending on the behaviours performed by different roles. Thus, this study supports the assumptions of theoretical models such as the cumulative assessment model and the energetic war of attrition, which predict that repeated signals advertise stamina and fighting ability, by demonstrating that mean rates of performance, a key component of stamina, are related to success in hermit crab shell fights. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Cumulative assessment model; Energetic war of attrition; Fight; Hermit crab; Pagurus bernhardus; Performance capacity; Resource-holding potential; Signal; Stamina","aggression; crab; marine ecosystem; metabolite; performance assessment; shell; signal; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Pagurus bernhardus",,,,,,"Abrahams, M.V., Robb, T.L., Hare, J.F., Effect of hypoxia on opercular displays: evidence for an honest signal?

However, the strength of nonlocal signal discrimination can vary asymmetrically across populations, a possibility that has received less attention. Such asymmetries can be due to recognition errors in some populations, variation across populations in the 'quality' of local individuals, such that populations with high-quality individuals respond more strongly, and/or variation in the perception of signals, with signals from some populations being perceived as more intimidating or aggressive. Here, we examine song differences and male responsiveness to local and nonlocal songs in two populations of the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens, and also explore possible reasons for geographical variation in responsiveness. In the northern population, male responses were stronger to local songs than to nonlocal songs, whereas in the southern population, male responses to local and nonlocal songs did not differ. Overall responsiveness did not differ between the populations, and songs from one population were not responded to more weakly (or strongly) across populations. Overall, our results fit best with a model of asymmetric recognition error. Asymmetries in nonlocal responsiveness across populations may be a common phenomenon, and can have profound effects on patterns of dispersal, mate choice and gene flow. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Asymmetric discrimination; Birdsong; Contest escalation; Dendroica; Dispersal; Game theory; Gene flow; Playback; Reproductive isolation; Sexual selection","aggression; asymmetric competition; dispersal; game theory; geographical variation; mate choice; migratory species; population distribution; reproductive isolation; sexual selection; signal; song; songbird; Dendroica; Dendroica caerulescens; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Baker, M.C., Vocal dialect recognition and population genetic consequences (1982) American Zoologist, 22, pp. 561-569; Balaban, E., Cultural and genetic variation in swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana): behavioural salience of geographic song variants (1988) Behaviour, 105, pp. 292-322; Ballentine, B., Morphological adaptation influences the evolution of a mating signal (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 1936-1944; Bee, M.A., Perrill, S.A., Owen, P.C., Male green frogs lower the pitch of acoustic signals in defense of territories: a possible dishonest signal of size?

We developed a new experimental methodology to measure individual movements of walking insects, based on radiotracking. Our aims were to understand the link between habitat heterogeneity and moving patterns, and to characterize the movements with dynamic models of diffusion. We tracked individual movements of adults of Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) with passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags under different field management practices. Diffusion models based on recapture data indicated a subdiffusive movement of this species. Substantial variation was found between individual paths, but this variation was not sex dependent. Movement of released C. sordidus was affected by banana planting pattern and the presence/absence of crop residues but not by the presence of a cover crop between rows of bananas or by banana variety. These results show that the RFID technology is useful for evaluating the dispersal parameters of cryptic insects in heterogeneous environments. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Circular statistics; Cosmopolites sordidus; Dispersal; Habitat preference; RFID; Tracking","beetle; dispersal; habitat mosaic; habitat selection; heterogeneity; management practice; movement; population structure; radiotelemetry; tracking; walking; Coleoptera; Cosmopolites sordidus; Curculionidae; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Arellano, L., Leon-Cortes, J.L., Ovaskainen, O., Patterns of abundance and movement in relation to landscape structure: a study of a common scarab (Canthon cyanellus cyanellus) in southern Mexico (2008) Landscape Ecology, 23, pp. 69-78; Banks, J.E., Yasenak, C.L., Effects of plot vegetation diversity and spatial scale on Coccinella septempunctata movement in the absence of prey (2003) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 108, pp. 197-204; Bates, D.M., Watts, D.G., (1988) Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications, , J.

Females may find males to be acceptable mates when (1) a male's immune system complements or matches the immune system of the receptive female (immunocompatibility), or (2) a male successfully signals that it has a strong immune system (immunocompetence). The first experiment used gas chromatography to compare the epicuticular hydrocarbon signature of a female beetle with that of a male she rejected and a male she accepted as a mate. We also compared the hydrocarbon signatures of a male and two fertilized females, one that had voluntarily accepted his spermatophore and one that was forced to accept the spermatophore. In both experiments the immune response to an implant inserted in the insect's abdomen was compared in males and their offspring. The hydrocarbon signature of males accepted as mates in the first experiment differed more from that of their female partners than did the hydrocarbon signature of rejected males. There was no significant difference in the immune response of accepted and rejected males. Offspring from forced matings had significantly lower immune responses than offspring from voluntary matings. This study suggests that females use immunocompatibility rather than immunocompetence as a trait to identify quality mates, which fosters stronger immune systems in offspring. Female choice of mates in this species may be self-referenced using the cuticular hydrocarbon signature of the female as a standard. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Chrysomelidae; Cuticular hydrocarbon; Diabrotica; Female choice; Immunocompatibility; Immunocompetence; Spotted cucumber beetle","beetle; chemical cue; cuticle; hydrocarbon; immune response; immune system; immunocompetence; life history trait; mate choice; parent-offspring interaction; parental investment; signaling; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Cucumis sativus; Diabrotica; Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Borgia, G., Sexual selection and the evolution of mating systems (1979) Sexual Selection and Reproductive Competition in Insects, pp. 19-80. , Academic Press, New York, M.S.

Whilst such models have produced encouraging results, the methods applied have been inconsistent and often problematic; furthermore, primates remain under-represented in such studies. This paper addresses both of these problems via the explanation of a novel and robust analytical method as applied to an extensive primate data set. In a study of a band of hamadryas baboons at the Filoha outpost of Awash National Park, Ethiopia from March 2005 to February 2006, the baboons' location was mapped every 15. min during all-day follows using a handheld GPS unit, yielding over 3000 step lengths and waiting times documented across 105 complete follows. Both power law and exponential models were fitted to the step length and waiting time data via maximum likelihood procedures within a model selection paradigm facilitated by the use of an information criterion to distinguish between models. Results show that the step lengths were exponentially distributed, and thus consistent with a random distribution of resources in space. Waiting times, however, were power law distributed, and thus consistent with a power law distribution of patch sizes. We evaluate these results within a discussion of the extent to which random search algorithms are applicable to animals with extensive knowledge of their habitats. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Hamadryas baboon; Lévy walk; Maximum likelihood; Random walk; Ranging; Resource structure; Spatial cognition; Step length; Waiting time","algorithm; data set; GPS; maximum likelihood analysis; movement; patch size; power law; primate; random walk method; resource availability; spatial cognition; Awash National Park; Ethiopia; Animalia; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates",,,,,,"Alados, C.L., Pueyo, Y., Giner, M.L., Navarro, T., Escos, J., Barroso, F., Cabezudo, B., Emlen, J.M., Quantitative characterization of the regressive ecological succession by fractal analysis of plant spatial patterns (2003) Ecological Modelling, 163, pp. 1-17; Alados, C.L., Pueyo, Y., Navas, D., Cabezudo, B., Gonzalez, A., Freeman, D.C., Fractal analysis of plant spatial patterns: a monitoring tool for vegetation transition shifts (2005) Biodiversity and Conservation, 14, pp. 1453-1468; Alonso, D., Bartumeus, F., Catalan, J., Mutual interference between predators can give rise to turing spatial patterns (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 28-34; Al-Safadi, M.M., The hamadryas baboon, Papio hamadryas (Linnaeus, 1758) in Yemen (Mammalia: Primates: Cercopithecidae) (1994) Zoology in the Middle East, 10, pp. 5-16; Altmann, S.A., Baboons, space, time, and energy (1974) American Zoologist, 14, pp. 221-248; Altmann, S.A., (1998) Foraging for Survival: Yearling Baboons in Africa, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Altmann, S.A., Altmann, J., (1970) Baboon Ecology, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Anderson, D.R., Burnham, K.P., Thompson, W.L., Null hypothesis testing: problems, prevalence, and an alternative (2000) Journal of Wildlife Management, 64, pp. 912-923; Anderson, J.R., Sleep-related behavioural adaptations in free-ranging anthropoid primates (2000) Sleep Medicine Reviews, 4, pp. 355-373; Anderson, T.W., Darling, D.A., Asymptotic theory of certain 'goodness of fit' criteria based on stochastic processes (1952) Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 23, pp. 193-212; Atkinson, R.P.D., Rhodes, C.J., Macdonald, D.W., Anderson, R.M., Scale-free dynamics in the movement patterns of jackals (2002) Oikos, 98, pp. 134-140; Austin, D., Bowen, W.D., McMillan, J.I., Intraspecific variation in movement patterns: modeling individual behaviour in a large marine predator (2004) Oikos, 105, pp. 15-30; Barton, R.A., Whiten, A., Strum, S.C., Byrne, R.W., Simpson, A.J., Habitat use and resource availability in baboons (1992) Animal Behaviour, 43, pp. 831-844; Bartumeus, F., Catalan, J., Fulco, U.L., Lyra, M.L., Viswanathan, G.M., Optimizing the encounter rate in biological interactions: Lévy versus Brownian strategies (2002) Physical Review Letters, 88, p. 097901; Bartumeus, F., Peters, F., Pueyo, S., Marrase, C., Catalan, J., Helical Lévy walks: adjusting searching statistics to resource availability in microzooplankton (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 100, pp. 12771-12775; Bartumeus, F., da Luz, M.G.E., Viswanathan, G.M., Catalan, J., Animal search strategies: a quantitative random-walk analysis (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 3078-3087; Bartumeus, F., Fernandez, P., da Luz, M.G.E., Catalan, J., Sole, R.V., Levin, S.A., Superdiffusion and encounter rates in diluted, low dimensional worlds (2008) European Physical Journal-Special Topics, 157, pp. 157-166; Benedix, J.H., Area-restricted search by the plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) in tallgrass prairie habitat (1993) Behavioral Ecology, 4, pp. 318-324; Benhamou, S., How many animals really do the Lévy walk?

In this sense, it is possible to speculate that the asymmetrical activation of the hemispheres, as a result of the exposure to a novel situation, may affect behavioural lateralization. We tested the hypothesis that novelty affects performance in a paw preference task in 37 habituated (HAB) and 37 control (CT) adult male Swiss mice. For 4 days prior to the first testing session, HAB mice were placed in the testing box daily. After the fourth session, animals were deprived of food for 24. h. On the 5th day, food pellets were placed inside a feeding tube and animals were allowed to make 25 successful retrievals of food pellets. The testing procedure was repeated 4 days later. CT mice were not submitted to the habituation sessions. A significant side-dependent difference in consistency of laterality was observed between groups in the first session: all (100%) right-pawed CT mice used their right paw to make their first successful retrieval of food in the first testing session, while only 61% of left-pawed mice used their left paw. The same pattern was observed when the first five retrievals were considered: 100% right-pawed CT mice and 72% left-pawed CT mice were consistent. No differences were observed in the HAB group: in both side-preference subgroups, 88% of the animals showed consistent laterality. These results indicate that behavioural lateralization in paw preference is affected by the novelty of the testing situation in a side-dependent manner. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Brain asymmetry; Consistency of laterality; Habituation; Pawedness","behavioral ecology; brain; food limitation; habituation; hypothesis testing; preference behavior; rodent; Animalia; Mus",,,,,,"Alaverdashvili, M., Leblond, H., Rossignol, S., Whishaw, I.Q., Cineradiographic (video X-ray) analysis of skilled reaching in a single pellet reaching task provides insight into relative contribution of body, head, oral, and forelimb movement in rats (2008) Behavioural Brain Research, 192, pp. 232-247; Annett, M., (2002) Handedness and Brain Asymmetry, , Psychology Press, East Sussex; Brown, J.V., Ettlinger, G., Intermanual transfer of mirror-image discrimination by monkeys (1983) Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology B, 35, pp. 119-124; Budilin, S.Y., Midzyanovskaya, I.S., Shchegolevskii, N.V., Ioffe, M.E., Bazyan, A.S., Asymmetry in dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens and motor preference in rats (2008) Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology, 38, pp. 991-994; Bulman-Fleming, M.B., Bryden, M.P., Rogers, T.T., Mouse paw preference: effects of variations in testing protocol (1997) Behavioural Brain Research, 86, pp. 79-87; Burton, A., Wilson, P., Hemisphere priming through practice in a musical chords task (1990) Neuropsychologia, 28, pp. 889-893; Cabib, S., D'Amato, F.R., Neveu, P.J., Deleplanque, B., Le Moal, M., Puglisi-Allegra, S., Paw preference and brain dopamine asymmetries (1995) Neuroscience, 64, pp. 427-432; Carlson, J.N., Fitzgerald, L.W., Keller, R.W., Glick, S.D., Side and region dependent changes in dopamine activation with various durations of restraint stress (1991) Brain Research, 550, pp. 313-318; Carlson, J.N., Fitzgerald, L.W., Keller, R.W., Glick, S.D., Lateralized changes in prefrontal cortical dopamine activity induced by controllable and uncontrollable stress in the rat (1993) Brain Research, 630, pp. 178-187; Castellano, M.A., Diaz-Palarea, M.D., Barroso, J., Rodriguez, M., Behavioral lateralization in rats and dopaminergic system: individual and population laterality (1989) Behavioral Neuroscience, 103, pp. 46-53; Collins, R.L., On the inheritance of handedness.

However, how primates are able to remember goal locations and travel efficiently is unclear. Few studies present consistent results regarding what reference system primates use to navigate, and what kind of spatial information they recognize. We analysed the pattern of navigation of one wild group of black capuchin monkeys, Cebus nigritus, at Atlantic Forest for 100 days in Carlos Botelho State Park (PECB), Brazil. We tested predictions based on the alternative hypotheses that black capuchin monkeys navigate using a sequence of landmarks as an egocentric reference system or an allocentric reference system, or both, depending on availability of food resources. The group location was recorded using a GPS device collecting coordinates at 5. min intervals, and route maps were generated using ArcView v9.3.1. The study group travelled through habitual routes during less than 30% of our study sample, and revisited resources from different starting points, using different paths and routes, even when prominent landmarks near feeding locations were not visible. The study group used habitual routes more frequently when high-quality foods were scarce, and navigated using different paths when revisiting food sources. Results support the hypothesis that black capuchin monkeys at PECB navigate using both egocentric and allocentric systems of reference, depending on the quality and distribution of the food resource they find. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Allocentric orientation; Atlantic Forest; Cebus; Route network; Spatial cognition; Topological map","ArcView; food availability; habituation; home range; hypothesis testing; movement; primate; recognition; spatial cognition; topology; wild population; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Cebidae; Cebus; Primates",,,,,,"Ab'Saber, A., (2003) Os domínios de Natureza no Brasil: Potencialidades Paisagísticas, , E.

In the Eurasian kestrel, Falco tinnunculus, a small raptor with a wide diet, parents often prepare prey prior to delivery at the nest, most notably by decapitation. We studied this behaviour by video monitoring prey deliveries at 29 nests for a total of about 200 days over 3 years. The probability of a prey item being decapitated prior to delivery differed between prey types and prey sizes; none of the insects or common lizards, Zootoca vivipara, and almost none of the shrews (Soricidae) were decapitated, whereas voles (Microtinae) and birds were commonly decapitated. For voles the probability of being decapitated decreased with nestling age, which supports the feeding constraint hypothesis because the nestlings' gape size limit and swallowing capacity would increase with age. For both voles and birds the probability of being decapitated increased with prey body mass, suggesting that kestrel nestlings may be unable to swallow, digest or egest skulls from larger prey. We suggest that the extent to which kestrel parents decapitate prey prior to delivery is an effect of their nestlings' age-dependent swallowing capacity and that the age of the nestlings therefore imposes constraints on the kestrel parents' foraging behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Decapitation; Eurasian kestrel; Falco tinnunculus; Feeding constraint hypothesis; Foraging; Gape size limit; Nestling development; Prey handling; Prey preparation; Raptor","body mass; diet; food provisioning; foraging behavior; gape limitation; nestling; parent-offspring interaction; parental investment; prey size; raptor; Arvicolinae; Aves; Falco tinnunculus; Hexapoda; Muridae; Raptores; Soricidae; Squamata; Zootoca vivipara",,,,,,"Asakskogen, E., (2003), Short term prey caching in nesting Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) in Norway.

For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aversive behaviour; Domestic dog; Erinaceus europaeus; European hedgehog; Meles meles; Mesopredation; Risk-sensitive behaviour; Road traffic; Urbanization","behavioral ecology; defense behavior; fat reserve; habitat selection; hibernation; human activity; nocturnal activity; predation risk; prey availability; reproductive behavior; risk assessment; roadkill; small mammal; temperature effect; urban area; urbanization; Canis familiaris; Erinaceidae; Erinaceus europaeus; Invertebrata; Mammalia; Meles meles; Taxidiinae",,,,,,"Aebischer, N.J., Robertson, P.A., Kenward, R.E., Compositional analysis of habitat use from animal radio-tracking data (1993) Ecology, 74, pp. 1313-1325; http://www.ptes.org/files/292_morsy04update.pdf, (Read 23 April 2008)AnonAnsell, R., Baker, P., Harris, S., The value of gardens for wildlife: lessons from mammals and herpetofauna (2001) British Wildlife, 13, pp. 77-84; Baker, P.J., Funk, S.M., Harris, S., White, P.C.L., Flexible spatial organization of foxes, Vulpes vulpes, before and during an outbreak of sarcoptic mange (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 127-146; Baker, P.J., Newman, T., Harris, S., Bristol's foxes: forty years of change (2001) British Wildlife, 12, pp. 411-417; Baker, P.J., Dowding, C.V., Molony, S.E., White, P.C.L., Harris, S., Activity patterns of urban red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) reduce the risk of traffic-induced mortality (2007) Behavioral Ecology, 18, pp. 716-724; Beyer, H.L., (2004) Hawth's Analysis Tool for ArcGIS, , http://www.spatialecology.com/htools/; Burt, P.J.A., Weather and pests (2002) Weather, 57, pp. 180-183; Campbell, P.A., Feeding rhythms of caged hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus L.)

To distinguish between group members and strangers in an efficient way, it would be adaptive for an animal to categorize conspecifics on the basis of familiarity. We investigated whether pigeons, Columba livia, are able to learn this categorization in a concept-like manner when trained with 2D images of conspecifics. Two of the six experimental pigeons were able correctly to classify test photographs of aviary mates which they had never seen as photographic stimuli before. Control animals, which had no real-life experience of the pictured conspecifics, all failed. This is a cognitively demanding task; not only are there no consistent visual features among group members, but photographic stimuli also present a much degraded version of the depicted pigeons. Further tests revealed that the familiarity concept could be transferred to nonconspecifics and that 24. h of exposure was enough for another pigeon to be classed as familiar. In sum, the findings show that pigeons (1) interpreted computer stimuli as representations of real entities, (2) possessed the ability to form a concept of familiarity and (3) were able to distinguish between social partners and strangers in nature. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Categorization; Columba livia; Concept; Familiarity; Individual recognition; Pigeon","adaptation; bird; conspecific; experimental study; familiarity; learning; mate recognition; photograph; Animalia; Columba; Columba livia",,,,,,"Aust, U., Huber, L., Picture-object recognition in pigeons: evidence of representational insight in a visual categorization task using a complementary information procedure (2006) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behaviour Processes, 32, pp. 190-195; Boysen, S.T., Berntson, G.G., Conspecific recognition in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes): cardiac responses to significant others (1989) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 103, pp. 215-220; Bradshaw, R.H., Conspecific discrimination and social preference in the laying hen (1992) Applied Animal Behavior Science, 33, pp. 69-75; Bradshaw, R.H., Dawkins, M.S., Slides of conspecifics as representatives of real animals in laying hens (Gallus domesticus) (1993) Behavioural Processes, 28, pp. 165-172; Dasser, V., Slides of group members as representations of the real animals (Macaca fascicularis) (1987) Ethology, 76, pp. 65-73; Dawkins, M.S., Distance and social recognition in hens: implications for the use of photographs as social stimuli (1996) Behaviour, 33, pp. 663-680; Dawkins, M.S., Guilford, T., Braithwaite, V.A., Krebs, J.R., Discrimination and recognition of photographs of places by homing pigeons (1996) Behavioural Processes, 36, pp. 27-38; D'Eath, R.B., Dawkins, M.S., Laying hens do not discriminate between video images of conspecifics (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 903-912; Delius, J.D., Emmerton, J., Hörster, W., Jäger, R., Ostheim, J., Picture-object recognition in pigeons (2000) Picture Perception in Animals, pp. 1-36. , Psychology Press, Hove, J.

Recent studies have found that domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, generally perform poorly on this task, and fail to improve performance significantly after repeated trials or generalize problem-solving strategies when conditions are reversed. In contrast, wolves, Canis lupus, have been shown to be more proficient at this task than their domestic counterparts. Wild canids, however, have yet to be tested on the V-shaped version of the detour task. We tested 20 sanctuary raised dingoes, Canis dingo, randomly allocated to one of four experimental conditions previously tested on dogs: inward detour (doors closed); outward detour (doors closed); inward detour (doors open); or inward detour (human demonstrator). Four trials were given for each condition, with the fifth trial reversed. Overall, dingoes completed the detour task successfully, with shorter latencies and fewer errors than dogs tested in previous studies. The results lend support to the idea that captive-raised wild canids are more adept at nonsocial problem solving than domestic dogs. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Canid; Canis dingo; Detour task; Dingo; Dog; Domestication; Intelligence; Problem solving","canid; captive population; domestication; experimental study; learning; wild population; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Canis familiaris dingo; Canis lupus",,,,,,"Chapuis, N., Thinus-Blanc, C., Poucet, B., Dissociation of mechanisms involved in dogs' oriented displacements (1983) Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 35 B, pp. 49-64; Chapuis, N., Detour and shortcut abilities in several species of mammals (1987) Cognitive Processes and Spatial Orientation in Animal and Man, pp. 97-106. , Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, P.

Maternal testosterone in egg yolk influences the embryo's and chick's development. Females deposit testosterone in the eggs as a response to the environment experienced during the laying period, including the quality of their mate. To assess the relevance of the female's mate selection on egg characteristics in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix, we tested breeding females in a choice trial where they were allowed to choose between two males. After the choice trials, females were mated either with their preferred male (P group) or with the nonpreferred one (NP group). Although eggs laid by females of the two groups did not differ significantly in mass, females of the P group laid eggs with a higher yolk testosterone concentration than females of the NP group. This study agrees with previous work pointing out that partner attractiveness may play an important role in the transfer of maternally derived egg components. © 2010.","Egg testosterone; Grey partridge; Mate choice; Maternal investment; Perdix perdix","breeding population; egg; gamebird; mate choice; parent-offspring interaction; parental investment; testosterone; Aves; Perdix perdix",,,,,,"Beani, L., Dessì-Fulgheri, F., Mate choice in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix: role of physical and behavioural male traits (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 347-356; Béguin, N., Leboucher, G., Kreutzer, M.L., Sexual preferences for mate song in female canaries (Serinus canaria) (1998) Behaviour, 135, pp. 1185-1196; Blount, J.D., Surai, P.F., Nager, R.G., Houston, D.C., Møller, A.P., Trewby, M.L., Kennedy, M.W., Carotenoids and egg quality in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus: a supplemental feeding study of maternal effects (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 29-36; Bolton, M., Determinants of chick survival in the lesser black-backed gull: relative contributions of egg size and parental quality (1991) Journal of Animal Ecology, 60, pp. 949-960; Burley, N.T., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Christians, J.K., Avian egg size: variation within species and inflexibility within individuals (2002) Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 77, pp. 1-26; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Cucco, M., Guasco, B., Malacarne, G., Ottonelli, R., Effects of β-carotene supplementation on chick growth, immune status and behaviour in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix (2006) Behavioural Processes, 73, pp. 325-332; Cucco, M., Malacarne, G., Ottonelli, R., Patrone, M., Repeatability of cell-mediated and innate immunity, and other fitness-related traits, in the grey partridge (2006) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 84, pp. 72-79; Cucco, M., Guasco, B., Malacarne, G., Ottonelli, R., Effects of β-carotene on adult immune condition and antibacterial activity in the eggs of the grey partridge, Perdix perdix (2007) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology, 147, pp. 1038-1046; Cucco, M., Guasco, B., Malacarne, G., Ottonelli, R., Tanvez, A., Yolk testosterone levels and dietary carotenoids influence growth and immunity of grey partridge chicks (2008) General and Comparative Endocrinology, 156, pp. 418-425; Cunningham, E.J.A., Russell, A.F., Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 74-77; Dahlgren, J., Females choose vigilant males: an experiment with the monogamous grey partridge, Perdix perdix (1990) Animal Behaviour, 39, pp. 646-651; Gil, D., Graves, J.A., Hazon, N., Wells, A., Male attractiveness and differential testosterone investment in zebra finch eggs (1999) Science, 286, pp. 126-128; Gil, D., Leboucher, G., Lacroix, A., Cue, R., Kreutzer, M.L., Female canaries produce eggs with greater amounts of testosterone when exposed to attractive male song (2004) Hormones and Behavior, 45, pp. 64-70; Gil, D., Ninni, P., Lacroix, A., De Lope, F., Tirard, C., Marzal, A., Møller, A.P., Yolk androgens in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica): a test of some adaptive hypotheses (2006) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 19, pp. 123-131; Gilbert, L., Williamson, K.A., Hazon, N., Graves, J.A., Maternal effects due to male attractiveness affect offspring development in the zebra finch (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 1765-1771; Gowaty, P.A., Reproductive compensation (2008) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 21, pp. 1189-1200; Harris, W.E., Uller, T., Reproductive investment when mate quality varies: differential allocation versus reproductive compensation (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 1039-1048; Kingma S.A, Komdeur J, Vedder O, von Engelhardt N, Korsten P, Groothuis, T.G.G., (2006), pp. 73-86. , http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/science/2006/p.korsten/PartII/c5.pdf, Rapid changes in maternal yolk hormone deposition in response to manipulated male attractiveness.

Previous studies have mainly investigated the relationship between brood size, brood age and the intensity of care. However, the impact of brood quality traits such as the offspring's average body size on parental investment has received relatively little attention. We examined the parental response to brood quality in the biparentally brood-caring cichlid fish Pelvicachromis taeniatus. We manipulated offspring quality by manipulating the food availability for the free-swimming fry and measured the parental response over 4 weeks. Generally, care decreased over the 4 weeks suggesting that parents adjust care to decreasing offspring vulnerability. However, parents of relatively low-quality broods, that is, of broods with relatively small average individual body size, showed a greater reduction in care than parents of high-quality broods resulting in a significant difference in care provided in the fourth week. The result suggests that parents adjust their care to brood quality and supports the predictions of the parental investment theory. Furthermore, mothers of high-quality fry were significantly more aggressive towards their partner than mothers of low-quality fry. This result is discussed in the context of parental response to brood value. Generally, females invested more in brood care than males. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Body size; Brood care; Brood size; Cichlid; Pelvicachromis taeniatus","body size; brood size; cichlid; food availability; maternal care; parent-offspring interaction; parental investment; Cichlidae; Pelvicachromis taeniatus",,,,,,"Baldauf, S.A., Kullmann, H., Schroth, S.H., Thünken, T., Bakker, T.C.M., You can't always get what you want: size assortative mating by mutual mate choice as a resolution of sexual conflict (2009) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 9, p. 129; Baldauf, S.A., Kullmann, H., Thünken, T., Winter, S., Bakker, T.C.M., Computer animation as a tool to study preferences in the cichlid Pelvicachromis taeniatus (2009) Journal of Fish Biology, 75, pp. 738-746; Barlow, G.W., (2000) The Cichlid Fishes, , Perseus Publishing, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Bashey, F., Competition as a selective mechanism for larger offspring size in guppies (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 104-113; Beissinger, S.R., Experimental brood manipulations and the monoparental threshold in snail kites (1990) American Naturalist, 136, pp. 20-38; Bize, P., Piault, R., Moreau, B., A UV signal of offspring condition mediates context-dependent parental favouritism (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 2063-2068; Boucher, D.H., On wasting parental investment (1977) American Naturalist, 111, pp. 786-788; Carlisle, T.R., Parental response to brood size in a cichlid fish (1985) Animal Behaviour, 33, pp. 234-238; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Vincent, A.C.J., Sexual selection and the potential reproductive rates of males and females (1991) Nature, 351, pp. 58-60; Coleman, R.M., Gross, M.R., Sargent, R.C., Parental investment decision rules: a test in bluegill sunfish (1985) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 18, pp. 59-66; Curio, E., Regelmann, K., Do great tit Parus major parents gear their brood defence to the quality of their young?

The use of relative criteria to estimate genetic relatedness could facilitate nepotism or inbreeding avoidance, and the use of absolute criteria to estimate genetic quality could help identify the fittest competitor or the best mate. For animals to process trade-offs between relatedness and quality, however, both relative and absolute genetic information must be concurrently available and detectable by conspecifics. Although there is increasing evidence to suggest that animals make genetically informed decisions about their partners, and may even process trade-offs, we understand relatively little about the sensory mechanisms informing these decisions. In previous analyses of the olfactory signals of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, we showed that both scrotal and labial secretions seasonally encode chemical information about (1) pairwise genetic relatedness, within and between the sexes, and (2) individual heterozygosity. Here, using a signaller-receiver paradigm, we conducted behavioural bioassays to test whether male and female lemurs are sensitive to these olfactory sources of genetic information in unfamiliar conspecifics. As the lemurs discriminated conspecific glandular secretions by pairwise relatedness and individual heterozygosity, volatile olfactory signals can be used by both sexes to concurrently process relative and absolute genetic information about conspecifics. Beyond supporting an olfactory mechanism of kin discrimination and mate choice in a primate, we suggest that animals could use olfactory processing to trade off between selection for the most compatible partner versus the most genetically diverse partner. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Chemical communication; Heterozygosity; Honest signalling; Inbreeding avoidance; Kin recognition; Mate choice; Nepotism; Primate; Sexual selection","conspecific; fitness; heterozygosity; honest signaling; inbreeding avoidance; kin recognition; mate choice; nepotism; olfactory cue; primate; relatedness; sexual selection; trade-off; Animalia; Lemur catta; Lemuridae; Primates; Strepsirhini",,,,,,"Andersson, M., Simmons, L.W., Sexual selection and mate choice (2006) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 296-302; Armitage, K.B., Social dynamics of mammals: reproductive success, kinship and individual fitness (1987) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 2, pp. 279-284; Belkhir, K., Castric, V., Bonhomme, F., Identix, a software for relatedness in a population using permutation methods (2002) Molecular Ecology Notes, 2, pp. 611-614; Blouin, S.F., Blouin, M., Inbreeding avoidance behaviors (1988) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 3, pp. 230-233; Boulet, M., Charpentier, M.J.E., Drea, C.M., Decoding an olfactory mechanism of kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in primates (2009) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 9, p. 281; Boulet, M., Crawford, J.C., Charpentier, M.J.E., Drea, C., M.

Previous studies have examined male behavioural responses to variation in immediate levels of sperm competition. Here we quantified the evolutionary responses of male adaptations resulting from long-term manipulation of the level of sperm competition. By varying the adult sex ratio of populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, we successfully altered the frequency of male and female copulations, and thus the level of sperm competition experienced by males. As predicted by theory, males evolving under higher levels of sperm competition increased investment in sperm production and differed in their sperm allocation patterns across matings, compared to males evolving under intermediate and low levels of sperm competition. However, we found no evidence for trade-offs between ejaculate components, or between total sperm production and male body size in this species. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Adult sex ratio; Fertile sperm; Indian meal moth; Nonfertile sperm; Plodia interpunctella; Sperm allocation; Sperm investment","adaptation; body size; moth; reproductive success; resource allocation; sex ratio; sperm competition; trade-off; Lepidoptera; Plodia interpunctella",,,,,,"Byrne, P.G., Roberts, J.D., Simmons, L.W., Sperm competition selects for increased testes mass in Australian frogs (2002) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 15, pp. 347-355; Cook, P.A., Gage, M.J.G., Effects of risks of sperm competition on the numbers of eupyrene and apyrene sperm ejaculated by the moth Plodia interpunctella (1995) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 36, pp. 261-268; Cook, P.A., Wedell, N., Ejaculate dynamics in butterflies: a strategy for maximizing fertilization success?

Conflict prevention might imply the ability to foresee future needs and the question whether animals have this capacity is still open to debate. A few studies have suggested that animals may be able to use anticipatory strategies of conflict management to decrease stress levels and prevent social tension caused by food competition. None the less, the effectiveness of these supposedly preventive strategies has rarely been investigated, and their cognitive requirements are still unclear. We explored these issues by observing a group of captive capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, subject to fixed scheduled feeding. We collected data on affiliative and aggressive interactions during three conditions: prefeeding, feeding and control. We found that grooming increased before a predictable competitive situation such as scheduled feeding, and that grooming reduced the risk of aggressive escalation and increased co-feeding during the subsequent feeding period. Therefore, prefeeding grooming served as a conflict prevention mechanism. Nevertheless, capuchin monkeys did not specifically select their prefeeding grooming partners on the basis of the expected benefits in the future competitive situation, suggesting that they were not planning their future behaviour, but were probably responding to the current tense situation. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Capuchin monkey; Cebus apella; Conflict prevention; Grooming; Planning; Prefeeding","affiliative behavior; aggression; captive population; cognition; feeding ecology; food availability; grooming; intraspecific interaction; primate; Animalia; Cebidae; Cebus; Cebus apella",,,,,,"Arnold, K., Aureli, F., Postconflict reconciliation (2007) Primates in Perspective, pp. 592-608. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, C.J.

The aim of our study was to identify deterrent molecules in the ink of Aplysia californica against an allopatric generalist crustacean predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and to define the mechanisms of action of the deterrents against crabs. We used two behavioural assays, a squirting assay and an ingestion assay, to show that ink is highly effective and that opaline is moderately effective in suppressing feeding of crabs. Results with reversibly blinded crabs demonstrate that the deterrence is mediated through the crabs' chemical senses. We used bioassay-guided fractionation to identify the purple molecules aplysioviolin and phycoerythrobilin as a major and minor deterrent, respectively, in ink against crabs. These molecules derive from a light-harvesting protein in the photosynthetic system of dietary algae. This is the first demonstration of an animal converting a photosynthetic pigment into a chemical deterrent. Mixing opaline and ink enzymatically produces hydrogen peroxide, which also functions as a chemical deterrent against crabs. Our results and those of other studies show that sea hares use a diversity of molecules in their skin, mucus and ink secretion to chemically defend themselves against their potential predators. Aplysioviolin, phycoerythrobilin and hydrogen peroxide also exist in ink secretion of Aplysia dactylomela, a sea hare sympatric to blue crabs, and thus we posit that these molecules are potentially effective in ecologically relevant predator-prey interactions and need to be scrutinized in more ecologically relevant experiments. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour..","Aplysia californica; Aplysioviolin; Callinectes sapidus; Chemical defence; Deterrent; Escapin; Phycobilin; Phycoerythrobilin; Predator-prey interaction; Tetrapyrrole","alga; allopatry; antipredator defense; bioassay; chemical defense; crab; diet; gastropod; hydrogen peroxide; marine ecosystem; pigment; predator-prey interaction; protein; secretion; skin; sympatry; algae; Anaspidea; Animalia; Aplysia; Aplysia californica; Aplysia dactylomela; Callinectes sapidus; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea)",,,,,,"Aggio, J.F., Derby, C.D., Hydrogen peroxide and other components in the ink of sea hares are chemical defenses against predatory spiny lobsters acting through non-antennular chemoreceptors (2008) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 363, pp. 28-34; Amsler, C.D., McClintock, J.B., Baker, B.J., Secondary metabolites as mediators of trophic interactions among Antarctic marine organisms (2001) American Zoologist, 41, pp. 17-26; Appleton, D.R., Babcock, R.C., Copp, B.R., Novel tryptophan-derived dipeptides and bioactive metabolites from the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela (2001) Tetrahedron, 57, pp. 10181-10189; Atema, J., Voigt, R., Behavior and sensory biology (1995) Biology of the Lobster Homarus americanus, pp. 313-349. , Academic Press, New York, J.R.

Calls can for example vary between individuals or between social and behavioural contexts. Calls also have the potential to vary between groups. Many group-living animals are known to produce stereotyped group-specific calls and such group signatures are thought to play a role in territory defence or indeed mate choice. Group signatures are generally found in long-distance call variants that work to maintain contact between group members, sometimes referred to as 'contact calls'. Cooperatively breeding, territorial meerkats, Suricata suricatta, also use contact calls, potentially to maintain social organization during foraging. However, these contact calls are generally quieter than long-distance calls in other species, and better described as 'close calls'. We investigated whether these similar call types also possess group-specific signatures and whether any such variation is used by receivers. We recorded close calls from 71 individuals belonging to 10 meerkat groups. We found that such close calls indeed possessed group signatures, but that this underlying variation did not appear to be used by receivers, possibly because meerkats use other sensory systems to identify nongroup members. We stress the importance of conducting playback experiments when investigating group-specific vocal signatures and use our results as a basis for predicting which animals may rely on group information encoded within close calls. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Contact call; Group signature; Meerkat; Playback; Suricata suricatta; Vocalization","behavioral ecology; defense behavior; mate choice; small mammal; social organization; stereotypic behavior; vocalization; Animalia; Suricata suricatta",,,,,,"Akcay, C., Wood, W.E., Searcy, W.A., Templeton, N., Campbell, E., Beecher, M.D., Good neighbour, bad neighbour: song sparrows retaliate against aggressive rivals (2009) Animal Behaviour, 78, pp. 97-102; Baker, M.C., Cunningham, M.A., The biology of bird-song dialects (1985) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 8, pp. 85-133; Balsby, T.J.S., Scarl, J.C., Sex-specific responses to vocal convergence and divergence of contact calls in orange-fronted conures (Aratinga canicularis) (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 275, pp. 2147-2154; Boughman, J.W., Greater spear-nosed bats give group-distinctive calls (1997) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 40, pp. 61-70; Bradbury, J.W., Vocal communication in wild parrots (2003) Animal Social Complexity: Intelligence, Culture and Individualized Societies, pp. 293-316. , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, F.B.M. de Waal, P.L.

Animals' responses to the calls of different individuals, to food calls, alarm calls, and to signals that predict behaviour, all suggest that recipients acquire information from signals and that this information affects their response. Some scientists, however, want to replace the concept of information with one based on the 'manipulation' of recipients by signallers through the induction of nervous-system responses. Here we review both theory and data that argue against hypotheses based exclusively on manipulation or on a fixed, obligatory link between a signal's physical features and the responses it elicits. Results from dozens of studies indicate that calls with 'arousing' or 'aversive' features may also contain information that affects receivers' responses; that acoustically similar calls can elicit different responses; acoustically different calls can elicit similar responses; and 'eavesdropping' animals respond to the relationship instantiated by signal sequences. Animal signals encode a surprisingly rich amount of information. The content of this information can be studied scientifically. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Animal communication; Animal signal; Information; Information transmission; Language; Meaning","behavioral ecology; calling behavior; hypothesis testing; information system; nervous system; signaling; Animalia",,,,,,"Altmann, J., (1980) Baboon Mothers and Infants, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Ballentine, B., Searcy, W.A., Nowicki, S., Reliable aggressive signaling in swamp sparrows (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 693-703; Beecher, M.D., Signaling systems for individual recognition: an information theory approach (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 248-261; Beecher, M.D., Campbell, E., The role of unshared songs in singing interactions between neighbouring song sparrows (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 1297-1304; Beecher, M.D., Stoddard, P.K., Campbell, S.E., Hornig, C.L., Repertoire matching between neighbouring song sparrows (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 917-923; Belin, P., Voice processing in human and nonhuman primates (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 361, pp. 2091-2107; Bergman, T.J., Beehner, J.C., Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., Hierarchical classification by rank and kinship in baboons (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1234-1236; Brooks, R.J., Falls, J.B., Individual recognition by song in white-throated sparrows.

On the other hand, females often vary greatly in their fecundity or other determinants of male reproductive success. There are two coexisting threads in the current literature on male mate choice: a number of studies emphasize that male mate choice has been underappreciated in the past, while another set reminds us that it nevertheless evolves less easily than female choice. Here we show that when mate choice is sequential rather than simultaneous (which is often the case for the mate-limited sex), male mate choice may fail to evolve even if there is large variation among fitness prospects offered by various females, and when mating is very costly. Our model is inspired by the mating system of the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Males of this species do not stop approaching females that have turned to face them even though this female behaviour greatly increases the risk of being cannibalized. We show that low mate availability can override the effect of all other factors that select for male mate choice: rejecting a current mating opportunity in the hope of better future opportunities is then not easily selected for. We conclude that studies of mate choice should examine why individuals refuse to take advantage of every opportunity, instead of merely focusing on the fact that some opportunities are better than others. Our results also call for more rigorous empirical tests of mate choice. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Male mate choice; Pseudomantis albofimbriata; Sexual cannibalism","cannibalism; fecundity; insect; life history trait; male behavior; mate choice; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; Mantidae; Mantodea",,,,,,"Amundsen, T., Forsgren, E., Male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 98, pp. 13155-13160; Arnold, S.J., Duvall, D., Animal mating systems: a synthesis based on selection theory (1994) American Naturalist, 143, pp. 317-348; Barry, K.L., In press.

While several studies have shown that receivers prefer temporally leading signals, we show that the relative timing of signal elements within overlapping signals can also have repeatable influences on receiver responses. Female grey treefrogs, Hyla versicolor, preferred overlapping conspecific advertisement call alternatives in which pulses were in the leading position relative to pulses in an alternative. The preference was maintained even when the first pulse of the stimulus with leading pulses began after that of the call with following pulses. To rule out the possibility of masking interference of the pulse pattern, we used a split-pulse design in which the playback of two nonoverlapping pulse elements were synchronized from spatially separated speakers. Females were attracted to the source of the short (6. ms) leading pulse element, which did not attract females in isolation, even though its amplitude was 24. dB lower than the long (24. ms) following element, which did attract females in isolation. Taken together, our results fall within a range of phenomena that have been classified as precedence effects. However, to our knowledge, showing localization based on successive leading pulses rather than the very first-arriving pulse is a novel discovery for nonhuman animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acoustic communication; Precedence effect; Signal timing","behavioral ecology; bioacoustics; calling behavior; conspecific; frog; preference behavior; signaling; Animalia; Hyla; Hyla versicolor",,,,,,"Bee, M.A., Riemersma, K.K., Does common spatial origin promote the auditory grouping of temporally separated signal elements in grey treefrogs?

For visual systems, delineating the effects of lighting on mating preferences is difficult because lighting conditions can affect preferences via three mechanisms: (1) genetic differentiation in mating preferences can result from selection under different lighting conditions, (2) development under different lighting conditions can alter the visual system and presumably female mating preferences and (3) lighting conditions can immediately alter colour perception by filtering wavelengths and altering visual backgrounds. We teased apart these effects by crossing bluefin killifish within and between a spring population and a swamp population that differed in lighting environment. We divided offspring between clear and tea-stained rearing environments (developmental plasticity) and measured preference under tea and clear conditions (immediate effects). We found genetic differentiation: spring offspring showed a strong preference for red males. We also found a three-way interaction between genetics, developmental plasticity and immediate effects on preference for blue males: swamp offspring had the highest levels of preference for blue males when raised and tested under tea-stained conditions. Thus, the environment experienced during development and the immediate conditions during mate selection interact with genetics to determine preference. We also tested the sensory bias hypothesis, which predicts that mating preferences evolve as a correlated response to selection on nonmating behaviours such as foraging. The relationship between mating and foraging preferences was weak and provided little support for sensory bias. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal .","Behavioural plasticity; Colour polymorphism; Fundulidae; Opsin expression; Sensory bias; Sensory drive; Sexual selection","behavioral response; color morph; environmental conditions; female behavior; genetic differentiation; hypothesis testing; light effect; mate choice; perception; sensory system; sexual selection; signaling; spring water; swamp; teleost; wavelength; Cyprinodontiformes; Fundulidae; Lucania goodei",,,,,,"Andersson, M.B., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Arnqvist, G., Sensory exploitation and sexual conflict (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 361, pp. 375-386; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bell, A.M., Hankison, S.J., Laskowski, K.L., The repeatability of behaviour: a meta-analysis (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 771-783; Boughman, J.W., Divergent sexual selection enhances reproductive isolation in sticklebacks (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 944-948; Boughman, J.W., How sensory drive can promote speciation (2002) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 17, pp. 571-577; Cheroske, A.G., Cronin, T.W., Caldwell, R.L., Adaptive color vision in Pullosquilla litoralis (Stomatopoda, Lysiosquilloidea) associated with spectral and intensity changes in light environment (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, 206, pp. 373-379; Cheroske, A.G., Barber, P.H., Cronin, T.W., Evolutionary variation in the expression of phenotypically plastic color vision in Caribbean mantis shrimps, genus Neogonodactylus (2006) Marine Biology, 150, pp. 213-220; Cronin, T.W., Caldwell, R.L., Tuning of photoreceptor function in three mantis shrimp species that inhabit a range of depths.

However, it has been suggested that echolocation calls may also have a communicative function, for instance between roost members. In principle, this seems possible because echolocation calls are species specific and known to differ between the sexes, and between colonies and individuals for some species. We performed playback experiments with lesser bulldog bats, Noctilio albiventris, to which we presented calls of familiar/unfamiliar conspecifics, cohabitant/noncohabitant heterospecifics and ultrasonic white noise as a control. Bats reacted with a complex repertoire of social behaviours and the intensity of their response differed significantly between stimulus categories. Stronger reactions were shown towards echolocation calls of unfamiliar conspecifics than towards heterospecifics and white noise. To our knowledge, this is the first time that bats have been found to react to echolocation calls with a suite of social behaviours. Our results also provide the first experimental evidence for acoustical differentiation by bats between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics, and of heterospecifics. Analysis of echolocation calls confirmed significant individual differences between echolocation calls. In addition, we found a nonsignificant trend towards group signatures in echolocation calls of N. albiventris. We suggest that echolocation calls used during orientation may also communicate species identity, group affiliation and individual identity. Our study highlights the communicative potential of sonar signals that have previously been categorized as cues in animal social systems. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Chiroptera; Communication; Eavesdropping; Lesser bulldog bat; Noctilio albiventris; Recognition; Social behaviour","auditory cue; bat; calling behavior; echolocation; experimental study; orientation behavior; recognition; roosting; sonar; Animalia; Chiroptera; Noctilio albiventris",,,,,,"Balcombe, J.P., Fenton, M.B., Eavesdropping by bats: the influence of echolocation call design and foraging strategy (1988) Ethology, 79, pp. 158-166; Barclay, R.M.R., Interindividual use of echolocation calls: eavesdropping by bats (1982) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 10, pp. 271-275; Beauchamp, G., Fernández-Juricic, E., The group-size paradox: effects of learning and patch departure rules (2005) Behavioral Ecology, 16, pp. 352-357; Bee, M.A., Individual recognition in animal species (2006) The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics: Vol. 2, pp. 617-626. , Elsevier Science, London, M.

Sexually cannibalistic mating systems provide an opportunity to examine male mate choice further: the high costs potentially involved in the mating process for males, as well as variation in female quality, predict male mate choice. We used the praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice in a system with frequent precopulatory sexual cannibalism. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize, so we predicted males would strongly prefer females in good condition to maximize their reproductive potential. Results of our simultaneous choice tests showed that males use chemical and visual cues for mate location and assessment, and that they can use either of these sensory modalities to distinguish and choose between females differing in body condition, with a significant preference for good-condition females. However, surprisingly, males rarely rejected poor-condition females in the more ecologically relevant scenario of only one immediate potential mate and both sensory modes available to them, which may be explained by the strong scramble competition known for praying mantid systems. These results show that even when female quality varies and the cost of mating for males is substantial, male mate rejection does not always evolve.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which males and females form friendships, or the function of friendships for males. We examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. A male's proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships. In 87% of births, the male that monopolized the greatest proportion of a female's consort days during her last conceptive cycle was the father of her offspring. In 82% of the births where the female's primary consort partner was present at parturition, he became her friend. When the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. Similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. Such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group. In a mating system with high dominance-based reproductive skew, males may benefit by investing preferentially in those infants that they are most likely to have fathered. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chacma baboon; consortship; friendship; infant care; mating strategy; Papio hamadryas ursinus; paternity","infanticide; mating behavior; parturition; paternity; preference behavior; primate; reproductive strategy; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Papio ursinus",,,,,,"Alberts, S.C., Watts, H.E., Altmann, J., Queuing and queue-jumping: long-term patterns of reproductive skew in male savannah baboons, Papio cynocephalus (2003) Animal Behaviour, 65, pp. 821-840; Alberts, S.C., Buchan, J.C., Altmann, J., Sexual selection in wild baboons: from mating opportunities to paternity success (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 1177-1196; Altmann, J., (1980) Baboon Mothers and Infants, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Baayen, R.H., (2008) Analyzing Linguistic Data: a Practical Introduction to Statistics Using R, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Boyko, R.H., Marshall, A.J., The willing cuckold: optimal paternity allocation, infanticide, and male reproductive strategies in mammals (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 1397-1407; Buchan, J.C., Alberts, S.C., Silk, J.B., Altmann, J., True paternal care in a multi-male primate society (2003) Nature, 425, pp. 179-181; Bulger, J.B., Dominance rank and access to estrous females in male savanna baboons (1993) Behaviour, 127, pp. 67-103; Busse, C., Hamilton III, W.J., Infant carrying by male chacma baboons (1981) Science, 212, pp. 1281-1283; Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., Fischer, J., Beehner, J.C., Bergman, T.J., Johnson, S.E., Kitchen, D.M., Silk, J.B., Factors affecting reproduction and mortality among baboons in the Okavango Delta, Botswana (2004) International Journal of Primatology, 25, pp. 401-428; Clarke, P.M.R., Henzi, S.P., Barrett, L., Sexual conflict in chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus): absent males select for proactive females (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 1217-1225; Clutton Brock, T.H., Mammalian mating systems (1989) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 236, pp. 339-372; Crawley, M.J., (2008) Statistics: an Introduction Using R, , J.

In infant markets, infants are the desired commodity, mothers control access to them, and other females (potential handlers) trade grooming for infant handling. The supply/demand ratio corresponds to the number of available infants per potential handler. Variation in the number of infants causes changes in the supply/demand ratio that can alter the market equilibrium. We investigated whether grooming was interchanged for handling in wild tufted capuchin females, Cebus apella nigritus. Behavioural observations were conducted on 10 mothers in three groups. Potential handlers were strongly attracted to infants and grooming the mothers (specifically, its occurrence rather than its duration) increased their probability of handling infants. However, the number of infants in the group did not affect the amount of grooming needed for access to infants. At least three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses can explain differences from previous findings. First, grooming in capuchin monkeys may represent a signal of benign intent with no market value. Second, dominance relations among handlers may have prevented competition by outbidding among handlers and thus hindered free trade. Third, the increased grooming required by mothers when infants were scarcer may reflect the need to calm more stressed mothers that were the subject of more frequent harassment; since in our study mothers did not appear to be more stressed when fewer infants were available, no effect of the number of infants on grooming by handlers emerged. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","biological market; Cebus apella nigritus; grooming; infant handling; New World primate; tufted capuchin","behavioral ecology; grooming; maternal care; primate; wild population; Cebidae; Cebus; Cebus apella nigritus; Primates",,,,,,"Altmann, J., (1980) Baboon Mothers and Infants, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Aureli, F., Post-conflict anxiety in nonhuman primates: the mediating role of emotion in conflict resolution (1997) Aggressive Behavior, 23, pp. 315-328; Aureli, F., Preston, S.D., de Waal, F.B.M., Heart rate responses to social interactions in free-moving rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): a pilot study (1999) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 113, pp. 59-65; Axelrod, R., Effective choice in the prisoner's dilemma (1980) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 24, pp. 3-25; Axén, A.H., Leimar, O., Hoffman, V., Signalling in a mutualistic interaction (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 321-333; Baldovino, M.C., Di Bitetti, M.S., Allonursing in tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus nigritus): milk or pacifier?

Web abandonment by orb spiders is a complex decision that is experimentally tractable. For females of the golden orb spider, Nephila clavipes, the web is a microhabitat that serves as a prey capture device, a mating site and a habitat for parasites. Thus, the web embodies the complexity of a bird territory or mammal home range, but is spatially compact and amenable to experimental manipulation. We used both field census data and field experimental manipulations to address the importance of prey capture rate, kleptoparasite load and male presence for web tenure (the time spent at a web site) in both mature and immature female N. clavipes. No factor explained variation in web tenure for immature females, although census data suggested that increased kleptoparasite load decreased web tenure. For mature females, increased male presence decreased web tenure, while increased prey capture rate, condition and body size all increased web tenure. Web tenure also decreased over the course of the season. Females integrate multiple cues to make web movement decisions. One of these cues is male presence, which detracts from the quality of a web site, suggesting that mate harassment might affect females' web movement decisions. Insight into this seemingly simple behaviour contributes to a growing understanding of how and when animals integrate multiple cues into behavioural decisions. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","context-dependent decision; foraging decision; habitat selection; kleptoparasite; male harassment; multimodal signalling; Nephila clavipes","body size; census; complexity; decision making; foraging behavior; habitat selection; home range; kleptoparasitism; microhabitat; movement; parasite; prey capture; signaling; spider; spider web; Animalia; Araneae; Aves; Mammalia; Nephila clavipes; Quadrula aurea",,,,,,"Adams, M.R., Choosing hunting sites: web site preferences of the orb weaver spider, Neoscona crucifera, relative to light cues (2000) Journal of Insect Behavior, 13, pp. 299-305; Agnarsson, I., Spider webs as habitat patches: the distribution of kleptoparasites (Argyrodes, Theridiidae) among host webs (Nephila, Tetragnathidae) (2003) Journal of Arachnology, 31, pp. 344-349; Allison, P.D., (1995) Survival Analysis Using the SAS System: a Practical Guide, , SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina; Andersson, M., Simmons, L.W., Sexual selection and mate choice (2006) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 296-302; Arnqvist, G., Multiple mating in a water strider: mutual benefits or intersexual conflict (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 749-756; Arnqvist, G., Pre-copulatory fighting in a water strider: intersexual conflict or male assessment (1992) Animal Behaviour, 43, pp. 559-567; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 145-164; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., Sexual conflict and arms races between the sexes: a morphological adaptation for control of mating in a female insect (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 261, pp. 123-127; Barghusen, L.E., Claussen, D.L., Anderson, M.S., Bailer, A.J., The effects of temperature on the web-building behaviour of the common house spider, Achaearanea tepidariorum (1997) Functional Ecology, 11, pp. 4-10; Barri, F.R., Martella, M.B., Navarro, J., Nest-site habitat selection by lesser rheas (Rhea pennata pennata) in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina (2009) Journal of Ornithology, 150, pp. 511-514; Bateson, P., (1983) Mate Choice, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bilde, T., Maklakov, A.A., Taylor, P.W., Lubin, Y., State-dependent decisions in nest site selection by a web-building spider (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 447-452; Blamires, S.J., Thompson, M.B., Hochuli, D.F., Habitat selection and web plasticity by the orb spider Argiope keyserlingi (Argiopidae): do they compromise foraging success for predator avoidance?

After an initial nest phase, workers begin foraging for nectar and pollen, but tend to bias their collection towards one or the other. Although foraging choices of honeybees are influenced by vitellogenin, an egg-yolk precursor protein, workers typically do not lay eggs. The forager reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH) proposes an evolutionary path in which the behavioural bias towards collecting nectar or pollen on foraging trips is influenced by variation in reproductive physiology, such as hormone levels and vitellogenin (vg) gene expression. Recently, the connections between vitellogenin and foraging behaviour were challenged by Oldroyd & Beekman (2008), who concluded from their study that the ovary, and especially vitellogenin, played no role in foraging behaviour of bees. We address their challenge directly by manipulating vg expression by RNA interference (RNAi) mediated gene knockdown in two honeybee genotypes with different foraging behaviour and reproductive physiology. We found that vg affected the food-loading decisions of the workers only in the genotype in which the timing of foraging onset (by age) was also sensitive to vitellogenin levels. In the second genotype, changing vitellogenin levels did not affect foraging onset or bias. The effect of vitellogenin on workers' age at foraging onset is explained by the well-supported double repressor hypothesis (DHR), which describes a mutually inhibitory relationship between vitellogenin and juvenile hormone (JH), an endocrine factor that influences development, reproduction and behaviour in many insects. These results support the RGPH and demonstrate how it intersects with an established mechanism of honeybee behavioural control. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apis mellifera;

After the learning phase, the subjects were presented with new pairs of photographs (KI versus UI: photographs that were not used in the learning phase), the same pairs presented in different associations, and finally pairs of photographs that were completely novel (50 different pairs). All the subjects selected the KI significantly more often than the UI under all conditions. Additional tests showed that the subjects preferentially selected photographs of a UI belonging to their own species versus a UI belonging to the other species.

Theoretical and empirical studies have highlighted an individual's body size and its relation with the partner's body size as potential factors that influence the preferred sex role. We studied effects of body size of focal individuals and partners on (1) mating frequency and mating interval, (2) courtship role and (3) number of sperm donated in successive copulations in the land snail Succinea putris where 'active' individuals mount the shell of their 'passive' partner before penises are intromitted reciprocally. We found body size-dependent differences in mating behaviour between small and large individuals: (1) smaller individuals of mating pairs were more likely to adopt the active role, (2) small individuals seemed to prefer inseminating larger partners, (3) a positive relation between body size and sperm number donated was found, (4) large individuals adjusted sperm number to their partner's body size, and (5) the smallest number of sperm was donated by large focal individuals to small partners. In addition, the number of sperm donated (1) increased with longer mating intervals and (2) decreased in later copulations indicating that the number of previous matings may affect male resource allocation. Our results support the view of models of sex role preferences, gender conflicts and solutions to gender conflicts that predict that the preferred sex role is variable within a species (e.g. size-dependent sex allocation models and the gender ratio hypothesis). © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","body size; courtship role; gender conflict; hermaphrodite; land snail; mating behaviour; sexual conflict; sperm donation; Succinea putris","body size; copulation; courtship; gender relations; hermaphrodite; preference behavior; resource allocation; sex allocation; sex role; sexual conflict; snail; sperm; Gastropoda; Stylommatophora; Succinea putris",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Chase, R., Dissociation of sexual arousal and sexual proclivity in the garden snail Helix aspersa (1990) Behavioral and Neural Biology, 54, pp. 115-130; Angeloni, L., Sexual selection in a simultaneous hermaphrodite with hypodermic insemination: body size, allocation to sexual roles and paternity (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 417-426; Angeloni, L., Bradbury, J.W., Body size influences mating strategies in a simultaneously hermaphroditic sea slug (1999) Ethology Ecology and Evolution, 11, pp. 187-195; Angeloni, L., Bradbury, J.W., Charnov, E.L., Body size and sex allocation in simultaneously hermaphroditic animals (2002) Behavioral Ecology, 13, pp. 419-426; Angeloni, L., Bradbury, J.W., Burton, R.S., Multiple mating, paternity, and body size in a simultaneous hermaphrodite, Aplysia californica (2003) Behavioral Ecology, 14, pp. 554-560; Anthes, N., Putz, A., Michiels, N.K., Sex role preferences, gender conflicts and sperm trading in simultaneous hermaphrodites: a new framework (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 1-12; Anthes, N., Putz, A., Michiels, N.K., Hermaphrodite sex role preferences: the role of partner body size, mating history and female fitness in the sea slug Chelidonura sandrana (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, pp. 359-367; Baur, B., Random mating by size in the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail Arianta arbustorum: experiments and an explanation (1992) Animal Behaviour, 43, pp. 511-518; Baur, B., Sperm competition in molluscs (1998) Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection, pp. 255-305. , Birkhead T.R., and Møller A.P.

Anecdotal and recent experimental observations show that pit vipers can use their infrared-imaging systems to discriminate between cool and warm features in the environment. We tested the hypothesis that the infrared-imaging system is a thermal contrast detector and determined whether behavioural responses of copperheads differ with contrast type. We found that blindfolded copperheads responded behaviourally towards both warm objects moving against cool backgrounds and cool objects moving against warm backgrounds. Responses towards the former were more robust than those towards the latter. Furthermore, oscillating warm targets generated rhythmic following behaviour in-phase with target motion, while oscillating cool targets generated rhythmic behavioural movement in antiphase to target motion. The results show that the infrared-imaging system of pit vipers operates on the basis of thermal contrast, but the differences in behavioural responses with respect to contrast type indicate that pit vipers preferentially target the warm aspect of thermal differentials. Our results also demonstrate that the infrared-imaging system allows defensive targeting of potential endothermic predators. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Agkistrodon contortrix; copperhead; defensive behaviour; imaging sensory system; infrared vision; pit organ; pit viper","antipredator defense; behavioral response; defense behavior; endothermy; hypothesis testing; imaging method; predator-prey interaction; snake; vision; Agkistrodon; Agkistrodon contortrix; Crotalinae",,,,,,"Bakken, G.S., Krochmal, A.R., The imaging properties and sensitivity of the facial pits of pitvipers as determined by optical and heat-transfer analysis (2007) Journal of Experimental Biology, 210, pp. 2801-2810; Breidenbach, C.H., Thermal cues influence strikes in pitless vipers (1990) Journal of Herpetology, 24, pp. 448-450; Bullock, T.H., Cowles, R.B., Physiology of an infrared receptor: the facial pit of pit vipers (1952) Science, 115, pp. 541-543; de Cock Buning, T., Goris, R.C., Terashima, S.I., The role of thermosensitivity in the feeding behavior of the pit viper Agkistrodon blomhoffi brevicaudus (1981) Japanese Journal of Herpetology, 9, pp. 7-27; Dunham, A.E., Grant, B.W., Overall, K.L., Interfaces between biophysical and physiological ecology and the population ecology of terrestrial vertebrate ectotherms (1989) Physiological Zoology, 62, pp. 335-355; Ebert, J., Westhoff, G., Behavioural examination of the infrared sensitivity of rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) (2006) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 192, pp. 941-947; Ernst, C.H., Ernst, E.M., (2003) Snakes of the United States and Canada, , Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C; Goris, R.C., Nomoto, M., Infrared reception in Crotaline snakes (1967) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, 23, pp. 879-892; Goris, R.C., Nakano, M., Atobe, Y., Funakoshi, K., The infrared sight of boas and pythons (2007) Biology of the Boas and Pythons, pp. 287-296. , Henderson R.W., and Powell R.

In nature, flies often face multiple potential partners and should have an acute sensory ability to discriminate between different pheromonal bouquets. We investigated both the pheromones and the chemosensory neurons influencing Drosophila mate choice. We measured various courtship traits in single tester males simultaneously presented with two target male and/or female flies carrying different pheromonal bouquets (pairs of control flies of the same or different sex, same-sex target pairs of pheromonal variant strains). The courtship traits reflected the perception of either olfactory cues perceived before or gustatory cues perceived after the first physical taste contact. Our results suggest that male mate choice exists in D. melanogaster and that male discrimination between potential mates could be a two-step process involving chemical cues perceived before and after the first gustatory contact. In addition, when a male was simultaneously presented with two potential sexual partners, the olfactory and gustatory cues he used depended on the pheromonal patterns of both flies, but his response could also depend on additional effects resulting from the simultaneous perception of the two flies, leading to a nonlinear choice of a sexual partner. Moreover, some tester males with genetically altered gustatory receptor neurons strongly changed their partner preference, indicating that the fly's peripheral nervous system is essential for pheromonal detection and mate choice. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","courtship; cuticular hydrocarbon; discrimination; Drosophila melanogaster; mate choice; olfaction; sex pheromone; taste","chemical cue; chemoreception; fly; mate choice; olfactory cue; perception; sex pheromone; taste; Drosophila melanogaster",,,,,,"Alipaz, J.A., Fang, S., Osada, N., Wu, C.I., Evolution of sexual isolation during secondary contact: genotypic versus phenotypic changes in laboratory populations (2005) American Naturalist, 165, pp. 420-428; Alipaz, J.A., Karr, T.L., Wu, C.I., Evolution of sexual isolation in laboratory populations: fitness differences between mating types and the associated hybrid incompatibilities (2005) American Naturalist, 165, pp. 429-438; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Antony, C., Davis, T.L., Carlson, D.A., Pechine, J.-M., Jallon, J.M., Compared behavioral responses of male Drosophila melanogaster (Canton-S) to natural and synthetic aphrodisiacs (1985) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 11, pp. 1617-1629; Antony, C., Jallon, J.M., The chemical basis for sex recognition in Drosophila melanogaster (1982) Journal of Insect Physiology, 28, pp. 873-880; Arienti, M., (1993) Analyse de la variabiliteé de quelques méćcanismes impliqués dans le comportement sexuel de populations différentes de Drosophila melanogaster, , Ph.D. thesis, Université de Paris Sud; Benton, R., Vannice, K.S., Gomez-Diaz, C., Vosshall, L.B., Variant ionotropic glutamate receptors as chemosensory receptors in Drosophila (2009) Cell, 136, pp. 149-162; Boll, W., Noll, M., The Drosophila Pox neuro gene: control of male courtship behavior and fertility as revealed by a complete dissection of all enhancers (2002) Development, 129, pp. 5667-5681; Bonduriansky, R., The evolution of male mate choice in insects: a synthesis of ideas and evidence (2001) Biological Reviews, 76, pp. 305-339; Brand, A.H., Perrimon, N., Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes (1993) Development, 118, pp. 401-415; Casares, P., Pineiro, R., Carracedo, M.C., Is premating isolation in Drosophila overestimated due to uncontrolled factors (2005) Journal of Genetics, 84, pp. 259-264; Chapman, T., Seminal fluid-mediated fitness traits in Drosophila (2001) Heredity, 87, pp. 511-521; Chapman, T., Liddle, L.F., Kalb, J.M., Wolfner, M.F., Partridge, L., Cost of mating in Drosophila melanogaster females is mediated by male accessory gland products (1995) Nature, 373, pp. 241-244; Cobb, M., Ferveur, J.F., Female mate discrimination or male responses to female stimulation?

Its defensive mechanisms against predatory spiny lobsters include deterrent compounds that are unpalatable and amino acids that stimulate appetitive responses (phagomimicry) or interfere with chemoreception (sensory disruption) by predators. The current study aimed to identify mechanisms whereby sea hares use ink secretion to defend against a fish predator, in this case the bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. We show that inking by live sea hares decreased the probability that wrasses strike sea hares. Ink protected sea hares by affecting two phases of feeding. First, an ink cloud between a wrasse and food decreased the probability that the wrasse captured the food. Second, if the wrasse captured food treated with ink, then that food was less likely to be accepted. In neither assay did opaline have a significant effect. Inactivating the olfactory sense of fish through nares occlusion eliminated the deterrent effect of ink on food capture but not the effect of ink on food acceptance, thus showing that olfaction mediates responses to deterrents during the capture phase of feeding and that nonolfactory chemical senses mediate responses to deterrents during the acceptance phase. These nonolfactory chemical senses may be intraoral senses, as fish did not reject pellets until after they were captured. Ink did not protect through phagomimicry, since neither ink nor opaline was accepted, despite the fact that mixtures containing the amino acid components of ink and opaline were accepted. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chemical defence; chemoreception; deterrent; opisthobranch; wrasse","amino acid; antipredator defense; chemical defense; chemoreception; food intake; gastropod; lobster; mimicry; olfactory cue; perciform; predator; secretion; Anaspidea; Aplysia; Aplysia californica; Labridae; Palinuridae; Thalassoma bifasciatum; Thalassoma lucasanum",,,,,,"Aggio, J.F., Derby, C.D., Hydrogen peroxide and other components in the ink of sea hares are chemical defenses against predatory spiny lobsters acting through non-antennular chemoreceptors (2008) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 363, pp. 28-34; Becerro, M.A., Starmer, J.A., Paul, V.J., Chemical defenses of cryptic and aposematic gastropterid molluscs feeding on their host sponge Dysidea granulosa (2006) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 32, pp. 1491-1500; Caprio, J., Derby, C.D., Aquatic animal models in the study of chemoreception (2008) The Senses: a Comprehensive Reference.

The remaining females are helpers called 'workers' that are mostly sterile. A paradigm in studies of eusociality is that worker sterility is a key to societal functions because advanced sociality cannot be achieved when there is conflict over reproduction. Yet, traits such as sensory responsiveness, foraging and hoarding behaviour that change between female reproductive life stages also vary between workers. This variation is central to worker division of labour, a complex social trait believed to be instrumental for the ecological success of animal societies. Thus, we took a step back from established views on worker sterility and societal functions, and hypothesized that division of labour can be better understood if adaptive variation in worker behaviour is seen as emerging from pre-existing mechanisms associated with female reproduction. In exploring this reproductive ground plan hypothesis (RGPH) in honeybee workers, we established that variation in foraging division of labour correlates with ovary size and is affected by expression changes in vitellogenin, an egg yolk protein precursor. Here, we explain and reconcile the RGPH with data on honeybee sensory sensitivity, genomic mapping, transcript and endocrine profiling, and link our discussion with Ihle et al. (2010, this issue, pp. 1001-1006). The findings bring together mechanistic and evolutionary explanations of honeybee worker behaviour. This essay suggests that a broader view on worker reproductive traits can increase the understanding of animal social behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","insulin-like signalling; juvenile hormone; nuclear hormone receptor; ovary; pollen hoarding; reproductive behaviour; social evolution; vitellogenin; worker behaviour","adaptive radiation; biological development; caching; eusociality; evolutionary biology; foraging behavior; gene expression; honeybee; hormone; hypothesis testing; labor division; life history trait; physiology; pollen; protein; sensory system; sexual conflict; signaling; social behavior; sterility; worker caste; Animalia; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Decapoda (Crustacea); Formicidae; Heterocephalus glaber; Hexapoda; Rattus",,,,,,"Amdam, G.V., Omholt, S.W., The hive bee to forager transition in honeybee colonies: the double repressor hypothesis (2003) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 223, pp. 451-464; Amdam, G.V., Page, R.E., Oldroyd and Beekman do not test ground plan hypothesis that explains origins of social behavior (2008) PLoS Biology, 6, pp. e56r2248; Amdam, G.V., Norberg, K., Hagen, A., Omholt, S.W., Social exploitation of vitellogenin (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 100, pp. 1799-1802; Amdam, G.V., Simões, Z.L.P., Guidugli, K.R., Norberg, K., Omholt, S.W., Disruption of vitellogenin gene function in adult honeybees by intra-abdominal injection of double-stranded RNA (2003) BMC Biotechnology, 3, pp. 1-8; Amdam, G.V., Hartfelder, K., Norberg, K., Hagen, A., Omholt, S.W., Altered physiology in worker honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) infested by the mite Varroa destructor (Acari: Varroidae): a factor in colony loss during over-wintering?

We investigated whether dominant beef cows, Bos taurus, have more influence on herd movement on pasture than more subordinate cows. A herd of 15 Gasconne cows was observed for a 3-week period between dawn and dusk. The positions of all adult cows were recorded with GPS collars at 1 min intervals and the behaviour of each cow was recorded in 5 min scans. The dominance hierarchy was recorded by ad libitum sampling. Through cluster analysis of the recorded data, we distinguished three herd behaviour patterns: resting, foraging and travelling. Dominant cows were closer to the front of the herd during both travelling and foraging. During travelling, more dominant cows also had more direct trajectories and were more aligned both with their nearest neighbours and with the whole herd. During foraging, the trajectories of dominant cows were shorter than those of subordinate cows. The results indicate that foraging and short-distance travelling movements by female beef cattle are not led by any particular individual but rather are influenced by a graded type of leadership; that is, the more dominant a cow is, the stronger the influence it may have on the movements of the herd. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bos taurus; cattle; dominance; foraging; GPS; group movement; leadership","cattle; cluster analysis; dominance; foraging behavior; GPS; group behavior; movement; pasture; Animalia; Bos; Bos taurus",,,,,,"Arave, C.W., Albright, J.L., Cattle behaviour (1981) Journal of Dairy Science, 64, pp. 1318-1329; Barta, Z., Flynn, R., Giraldeau, L.A., Geometry for a selfish foraging group: a genetic algorithm approach (1997) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 264, pp. 1233-1238; Beauchamp, G., Individual differences in activity and exploration influence leadership in pairs of foraging zebra finches (2000) Behaviour, 137, pp. 301-314; Bennett, I.L., Holmes, C.R., Formation of a feeding order in a group of cattle and its relationship with grazing behavior, heat tolerance and production (1987) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 17, pp. 9-18; Brooks, C., Bonyongo, C., Harris, S., Effects of global positioning system collar weight on zebra behavior and location error (2008) Journal of Wildlife Management, 72, pp. 527-534; Bumann, D., Krause, J., Rubenstein, D., Mortality risk of spatial positions in animal groups: the danger of being in the front (1997) Behaviour, 134, pp. 1063-1076; Conradt, L., Roper, T.J., Group decision-making in animals (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 155-158; Conradt, L., Roper, T.J., Democracy in animals: the evolution of shared group decisions (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 2317-2326; Conradt, L., Krause, J., Couzin, I.D., Roper, T.J., 'Leading according to need' in self-organizing groups (2009) American Naturalist, 173, pp. 304-312; Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., James, R., Ruxton, G.D., Franks, N.R., Collective memory and spatial sorting in animal groups (2002) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 218, pp. 1-11; Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., Franks, N.R., Levin, S.A., Effective leadership and decision-making in animal groups on the move (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 513-516; Dumont, B., Hill, D.R.C., Multi-agent simulation of group foraging in sheep: effects of spatial memory, conspecific attraction and plot size (2001) Ecological Modelling, 141, pp. 201-215; Dumont, B., Boissy, A., Achard, C., Sibbald, A.M., Erhard, H.W., Consistency of animal order in spontaneous group movements allows the measurement of leadership in a group of grazing heifers (2005) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 95, pp. 55-66; Dyer, J.R.G., Johansson, A., Helbing, D., Cousin, I.D., Krause, J., Leadership, consensus decision making and collective behaviour in humans (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 781-789; Fischhoff, I.R., Sundaresan, S.R., Cordingley, J., Larkin, H.M., Sellier, M., Rubenstein, D., Social relationships and reproductive state influence leadership roles in movements of plains zebra, Equus burchelli (2007) Animal Behaviour, 73, pp. 825-831; Hamilton, W.D., Geometry for selfish herd (1971) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 31, pp. 295-311; Hemelrijk, C.K., Towards the integration of social dominance and spatial structure (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 1035-1048; James, R., Bennett, P.G., Krause, J., Geometry for mutualistic and selfish herds: the limited domain of danger (2004) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 228, pp. 107-113; Johnson, D.D., Ganskopp, D.C., Gps collar sampling frequency: effects on measures of resource use (2008) Rangeland Ecology and Management, 61 (2), pp. 226-231; Kabuga, J.D., Social relationships in N'dama cattle during supplementary feeding (1992) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 34, pp. 285-290; Kabuga, J.D., The standing behavior of N'dama cattle during idling in a night paddock (1993) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 37, pp. 17-29; Kaufman, L., Rousseeuw, P.J., (1990) Finding Groups in Data: an Introduction to Cluster Analysis, , J.

The relative role of low- and high-pitched bleats provided by the mother in this early preference is not clear. While acoustic recognition is clearly established in 2-day-old lambs, it is not known whether lambs use an individual acoustic signature, or some other feature of acoustic communication (type of bleat or a combination of responses) by the mother indicating acceptance. The acoustic analysis of bleats demonstrated that both types of vocalization can support individual discrimination and that frequency spectrum and amplitude modulation exhibit an individual stereotypy. However, the characteristics of bleats and the quantity of encoding information in them differed between low- and high-pitched bleats. In two-choice procedures, we tested the ability of 48 h-old lambs to discriminate between recorded bleats of their own mother and an unfamiliar equivalent mother. Lambs showed a preference for the playback of low-pitched bleats of their own mother, but not for high-pitched bleats. Therefore, 48 h-old lambs can use an individual acoustic signature to recognize their own mother when low-pitched bleats are used. In contrast when high-pitched bleats are used, a vocal exchange between the mother and her lamb appears necessary. We conclude that 48 h-old lambs are able to learn and recognize the individual characteristics of their mother's low-pitched bleats and that this vocal recognition may be important for the establishment of the mother-young bond even at this early stage of the relationship. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustics; bleat; high-pitched vocalization; low-pitched vocalization; maternal behaviour; Ovis aries; playback; sheep; vocal recognition","behavioral ecology; behavioral response; frequency dependence; parental care; sheep; vocalization; Ovis aries",,,,,,"Alexander, G., Odour, and the recognition of lambs by Merino ewes (1978) Applied Animal Ethology, 4, pp. 153-158; Aubin, T., Jouventin, P., Localisation of an acoustic signal in a noisy environment: the display call of the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus (2002) Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 3793-3798; Barratt, M.S., Roach, M.A., Early interactive processes: parenting by adolescent and adult single mothers (1995) Infant Behavior and Development, 18, pp. 97-109; Beecher, M.D., Signature systems and kin recognition (1982) American Zoologist, 22, pp. 477-490; Beecher, M.D., Signalling systems for individual recognition: an information theory approach (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 248-261; Biben, M., Symmes, D., Bernhards, D., Contour variables in vocal communication between squirrel monkey mothers and infants (1989) Developmental Psychobiology, 22, pp. 617-631; Boinski, S., Mitchell, C.M., Wild squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) caregiver calls: context and acoustic structure (1995) American Journal of Primatology, 35, pp. 129-137; Charrier, I., Mathevon, N., Jouventin, P., Vocal signature recognition of mothers by fur seal pups (2003) Animal Behaviour, 65, pp. 543-550; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Cooper, R.P., Abraham, J., Berman, S., Staska, M., The development of infants' preference for motherese (1997) Infant Behavior and Development, 20, pp. 477-488; Dwyer, C.M., Genetic and physiological determinants of maternal behavior and lamb survival: implications for low-input sheep management (2008) Journal of Animal Science, 86, pp. 246-258; Dwyer, C.M., Lawrence, A.B., Maternal behaviour in domestic sheep (Ovis aries): constancy and change with maternal experience (2000) Behaviour, 137, pp. 1391-1413; Dwyer, C.M., McLean, K.A., Chirnside, J., Calvert, S.K., Lawrence, A.B., The role of maternal vocalizations in parturient sheep (1997) Proceedings of the 31st International Congress of the ISAE, p. 66. , Hemsworth P.H., Spinka M., and Kostal L.

Such blends need to be recognized against the odorous background of the habitat. The egg parasitoid Closterocerus ruforum is known to be attracted to plant volatiles induced by egg deposition of its herbivorous host, the pine sawfly Diprion pini. The parasitoid has to detect this volatile signal against a background of other pine volatiles (i.e. odour from pine without host eggs). Previous studies have shown that attractive resource-indicating odour (pine with host eggs) and nonattractive habitat odour (pine without eggs) differ only by enhanced quantities of (E)-β-farnesene in the resource-indicating odour. However, (E)-β-farnesene per se was not attractive. We studied the relevance of quantitative ratios of (E)-β-farnesene and other pine volatiles present in the habitat for parasitoid orientation by electrophysiological methods (EAG) and behavioural (olfactometer) assays. Seven of 12 terpenoid pine volatiles elicited an EAG response. In tests of the parasitoid's behavioural response to EAG-active volatiles, a blend of five components (including (E)-β-farnesene) was sufficient to attract the parasitoid but only when the ratio of (E)-β-farnesene and the other compounds matched that in odour from egg-laden pine. Since the quantities of volatiles from egg-laden and egg-free pine are not significantly different except for (E)-β-farnesene, our results show that the quantity of a resource-indicating key compound (here (E)-β-farnesene) is validated by its ratio to quantities of background volatiles emitted by both the resource and the habitat. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Closterocerus ruforum; EAG; habitat odour; host location; olfactory orientation; parasitic wasp; plant volatile; terpenoid","behavioral response; bioassay; egg parasitoid; fly; host location; host-parasitoid interaction; odor; orientation behavior; resource availability; terpene; volatile substance; wasp; Closterocerus; Diprion pini; Hexapoda; Vespoidea",,,,,,"Al Abassi, S., Birkett, M.A., Pettersson, J., Pickett, J.A., Wadhams, L.J., Woodcock, C.M., Response of the seven-spot ladybird to an aphid alarm pheromone and an alarm pheromone inhibitor is mediated by paired olfactory cells (2000) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 27, pp. 1765-1771; Bombosch, S., Ramakers, P.M.J., Zur Dauerzucht von Gilpinia hercyniae (1976) Zeitschrift für Pflanzenkrankheiten und Pflanzenschutz, 83, pp. 40-44; Bruce, T.J.A., Wadhams, L.J., Woodcock, C.M., Insect host location: a volatile situation (2005) Trends in Plant Science, 10, pp. 269-274; de Bruyne, M., Baker, T.C., Odor detection in insects: volatile codes (2008) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 34, pp. 882-897; Dicke, M., Behavioural and community ecology of plants that cry for help (2009) Plant, Cell and Environment, 32, pp. 654-665; Dickens, J.C., Olfaction in the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis BOH.

Prey with information about predation risk are more successful in surviving encounters with predators than are unwary prey. To remain prepared for attack, prey should continue to monitor the status of predation risk, presenting a behavioural trade-off for prey: increased distance from areas labelled with alarm cues reduces exposure to predation risk but also reduces access to information about predation risk. In two laboratory experiments we used the presence and absence of water flow in a laboratory fluvarium to test alarm response and subsequent risk-sensitive information gathering by zebrafish (Danio rerio). In response to chemical alarm cues, fish significantly reduced activity and increased use of shelters. In the absence of flow, fish sought out the shelter nearest the cue source. In the presence of flow, fish preferred to seek shelter downstream, but not upstream, of the cue source. This allowed fish to gather information about predation risk from a relatively safe distance. In a field experiment on natural populations of stream fishes, fish avoided areas where chemical alarm cues were released (versus blank water control) but primarily because they avoided the region immediately upstream of the cue source. Fish use of the area immediately downstream of cue release did not decrease. Taken together, these laboratory and field data are consistent with a trade-off between risk avoidance and information gathering. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alarm cue; antipredator behaviour; chemical cue; field study; information gathering; risk-sensitive behaviour; zebrafish","alarm signal; chemical cue; cyprinid; habitat selection; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; stream; trade-off; water flow; Cyprinidae; Danio rerio; Pisces",,,,,,"Brown, G.E., Godin, J.-G.J., Who dares, learns: chemical inspection behaviour and acquired predator recognition in a characin fish (1999) Animal Behaviour, 57, pp. 475-481; Brown, G.E., Godin, J.-G.J., Pederson, J., Fin flicking: a visual antipredator alarm signal in a characin fish (Hemigrammus erythrozonus) (1999) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 469-476; Brown, G.E., Golub, J.L., Plata, D., Attack cone avoidance during predator inspection visits by wild finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus): the effects of predator diet (2001) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 27, pp. 1657-1666; Chivers, D.P., Smith, R.J.F., Chemical alarm signalling in aquatic predator-prey systems: a review and prospectus (1998) Écoscience, 5, pp. 338-352; Chivers, D.P., Mirza, R.S., Johnston, J., Learned recognition of heterospecific alarm cues enhances survival during encounters with predators (2002) Behaviour, 139, pp. 929-938; Dahl, J., Nilsson, P.A., Petterson, L.B., Against the flow: chemical detection of downstream predators in running waters (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 265, pp. 1339-1344; Danchin, E., Giraldeau, L.-A., Valone, T.J., Wagner, R.H., Public information: from nosy neighbors to cultural evolution (2004) Science, 305, pp. 487-491; Dugatkin, L.A., Godin, J.-G.J., Prey approaching their predators: a cost benefit perspective (1992) Annales Zoologici Fennici, 29, pp. 233-252; Engeszer, R.E., Patterson, L.B., Rao, A.A., Parichy, D.M., Zebrafish in the wild: a review of natural history and new notes from the field (2007) Zebrafish, 4, pp. 21-40; Ferner, M.C., Smee, D.L., Weissburg, M.J., Habitat complexity alters lethal and non-lethal olfactory interactions between predators and prey (2009) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 374, pp. 13-22; Garcia, C., Rolan-Alvarez, E., Sanchez, L., Alarm reaction and alert state in Gambusia affinis (Pisces, Poeciliidae) in response to chemical stimuli from injured conspecifics (1992) Journal of Ethology, 10, pp. 41-46; Gibson, A.K., Mathis, A., Opercular beat rate for rainbow darters Etheostoma caeruleum exposed to chemical stimuli conspecific and heterospecific fishes (2006) Journal of Fish Biology, 69, pp. 224-232; Hall, D., Suboski, M.D., Visual and olfactory stimuli in learned release of alarm reactions by zebra danio fish (Brachydanio rerio) (1995) Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, 63, pp. 229-240; Hews, D.K., Alarm response in larval western toads, Bufo boreas: release of larval chemicals by a natural predator and its effect on predator capture efficiency (1988) Animal Behaviour, 36, pp. 125-133; Irving, P.W., Magurran, A.E., Context-dependent fright reactions in captive European minnows: the importance of naturalness in laboratory experiments (1997) Animal Behaviour, 53, pp. 1193-1201; Keenleyside, M.H.A., (1955) Some Aspects of the Schooling Behaviour of Fish, , E.J.

Fighting can vary among males, however, such that some males are highly aggressive whereas others are not. We observed that fighting was negatively associated with flight capability in the wing-dimorphic field cricket, Gryllus texensis. Long-winged males capable of flight had a significantly lower fighting propensity and displayed lower levels of aggression than short-winged, flight-incapable males in staged contests. Long-winged males no longer able to fly as a result of the histolysis of their flight muscles were more aggressive than long-winged males that had functional flight muscles, but were still less aggressive than short-winged males. Long-winged, flight-capable males were more aggressive after a brief flight just prior to an interaction with a rival, but only in contests with other flight-capable males. Flight capability and flight itself had no effect on the outcome of fights. Our results support the existence of an aggression flight syndrome in flight-dimorphic insects. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression flight syndrome; agonistic behaviour; flight; flight-muscle dimorphism; flight-muscle histolysis; life history trade-off; wing polymorphism","cricket; fighting; flight; life history trait; muscle; trade-off; Gryllinae; Gryllus texensis; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Hoy, R.R., Agonistic behaviour in male and female field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, and how behavioural context influences its expression (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1491-1501; Alexander, R.D., Aggressiveness, territoriality and sexual behaviour in field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) (1961) Behaviour, 17, pp. 130-223; Anderson, C., Cremer, S., Heinze, J., Live and let die: why fighter males of the ant Cardiocondyla kill each other but tolerate their winged rivals (2003) Behavioral Ecology, 14, pp. 54-62; Archer, J., (1988) The Behavioural Biology of Aggression, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Cade, W.H., Field cricket dispersal flights measured by crickets landing at lights (1979) Texas Journal of Science, 31, pp. 125-130; Cade, W.H., Field cricket spacing and the phonotaxis of crickets and parasitoid flies to clumped and isolated cricket songs (1981) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 55, pp. 365-375; Cade, W.H., Otte, D., Gryllus texensis n. sp.: a widely studied field cricket (Orthoptera; Gryllidae) from the southern United States (2000) Transactions of the American Entomological Society, 126, pp. 117-123; Cade, W.H., Wyatt, D.R., Factors affecting calling behaviour in field crickets, Teleogryllus and Gryllus (age, weight, density, and parasites) (1984) Behaviour, 88, pp. 61-75; Crespi, B.J., Adaptation, compromise, and constraint: the development, morphometrics, and behavioral basis of a fighter-flier polymorphism in male Hoplothrips karnyi (Insecta: Thysanoptera) (1988) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 23, pp. 93-104; Crnokrak, P., Roff, D.A., Fitness differences associated with calling behaviour in the two wing morphs of male sand crickets, Gryllus firmus (1995) Animal Behaviour, 50, pp. 1475-1481; Dawkins, R., Good strategy or evolutionary stable strategy?

The green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi, is a predominantly polyandrous species with male nutrient donation transferred within the ejaculate at mating. Male ejaculates that are exaggerated in size or content can be interpreted as a means to reduce female remating. We explored whether geographical variation in the degree of polyandry among P. napi populations results from variation in the male's ability to manipulate females to mate at a suboptimal rate. Females that mated with a larger male capable of delivering a large spermatophore remated later than those that mated with a smaller male. However, we found no spatial variation in sexual size dimorphism or relative ejaculate size. Moreover, the mating frequency of females was not affected by the origin of males with which they mated. We argue that even if large male ejaculates evolved to ensure paternity of a given male with negative side-effects on female fitness, female counteradaptations conceal possible implications of antagonistic coevolution. Geographical variation in female mating frequency is probably maintained by selection acting upon female life history traits associated with the degree of polyandry. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","green-veined white butterfly; monandry; nuptial feeding; Pieris napi; polyandry; sexual conflict","body size; butterfly; coevolution; fitness; geographical variation; life history trait; nuptial gift; paternity; polyandry; reproductive cost; reproductive strategy; sexual conflict; size distribution; spermatophore; Pieris brassicae; Pieris napi",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Andersson, J., Borg-Karlsson, A.-K., Wiklund, C., Sexual conflict and anti-aphrodisiac titre in a polyandrous butterfly: male ejaculate tailoring and absence of female control (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. 1765-1770; Arnqvist, G., Multiple mating in a water strider: mutual benefits or intersexual conflict?

Two mechanisms whereby animals reach a consensus include 'consistent leadership', in which a single dominant individual makes the decision, and 'variable leadership' in which several group members contribute to the decision outcome. Sharing of consensus decisions is expected to reduce consensus costs to most group members. Both patterns are thought to emerge from the complexity of social relationships of group members. We investigated the distribution of leadership during group departures in two packs of free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, and tested how its distribution between individuals was affected by dominance rank-related affiliative and agonistic relationships. Although leadership was not entirely concentrated on a single group member, both packs had a limited number of habitual leaders. In the largest pack, the pattern of leadership changed from 'variable' to nearly 'consistent' after its size had shrunk. Habitual leaders were usually old and high-ranking individuals. However, high-ranking dogs that received affiliative submissions in greeting ceremonies were more likely to lead than dominant dogs receiving submissions only in agonistic contexts. During resting times, habitual followers associated more closely with habitual leaders than with other followers. These results suggest that in social species collective movements may arise from the effort of subordinates to maintain close proximity with specific valuable social partners. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","affiliative relationship; agonistic dominance; Canis lupus familiaris; consensus costs; consensus decisions; domestic dog; formal dominance; individual variation in leadership","affiliative behavior; agonistic behavior; canid; dominance; group behavior; Animalia; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Bekoff, M., Scent-marking by free-ranging domestic dogs (1979) Biology of Behavior, 4, pp. 123-139; Boitani, L., Ciucci, P., Comparative social ecology of feral dogs and wolves (1995) Ethology, Ecology and Evolution, 7, pp. 49-72; Boitani, L., Francisci, F., Ciucci, P., Andreoli, G., Population biology and ecology of feral dogs in central Italy (1995) The Domestic Dog: its Evolution, Behaviour and Interactions with People, pp. 217-244. , Serpell J.

Patterns of natal dispersal vary widely depending on the selection pressures that each species encounters, but the underlying factors determining this variation are poorly understood. We studied the pattern of natal dispersal in a small passerine, the vinous-throated parrotbill, Paradoxornis webbianus, using both direct ringing data and indirect genetic methods. The social structure of this species is characterized by group living without apparent territorial behaviour. The dispersal rate of juveniles from their natal groups was moderate (about 40%) and dispersal distance was short, most individuals moving to neighbouring flocks. Sibling groups that included both sexes usually dispersed or were philopatric together so that they were found in the same winter flock where pairing occurs. Thus, the avoidance of inbreeding or intrasexual competition among siblings appears not to affect natal dispersal in this species. Instead, our results suggest that the benefits of dispersing in groups and/or selection of kin structure within social groups via kin-selected reproductive benefits may promote the observed dispersal pattern: sibling associations without separation of the sexes. This behaviour may have important implications for the kin structure of populations and the evolution of sociality. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","kin structure; natal dispersal; Paradoxornis webbianus; philopatry; sex-biased dispersal; sibling coalition; vinous-throated parrotbill","avoidance reaction; eusociality; evolutionary biology; kin selection; natal dispersal; passerine; philopatry; reproductive cost; selection; sibling; social structure; territoriality; Aves; Paradoxornis webbianus; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Arcese, P., Intrasexual competition, mating system and natal dispersal in song sparrows (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 958-979; Beauchamp, G., Reduced flocking by birds on islands with relaxed predation (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. 1039-1042; Bengtsson, B.O., Avoiding inbreeding: at what cost?

Generally, time spent bedded is considered a proxy for time spent ruminating. Researchers rarely include measures of interindividual differences in the intensity and time spent ruminating. We explored individual variation in rumination behaviour in Rocky mountain bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis. We expected rumination to be a plastic behaviour affected by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as body mass, age, sex, reproductive status and environmental conditions. We investigated rumination behaviour based on (1) mean number of chews per bolus of food (chews/bolus), (2) mean number of chews per second per bolus (chewing rate) and (3) mean time spent chewing per bolus (bolus processing time) for sheep of known age, sex, body mass and reproductive status. Our results show that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affected rumination behaviour. Females tended to spend less time processing each bolus than males of similar body mass, resulting in a significantly higher chewing rate for females. There was no difference in chews/bolus between sexes. Environmental factors and group size also affected rumination behaviour: cold temperatures were associated with fewer chews/bolus; wind was associated with more chews/bolus. Sheep in larger groups had a slower rate of rumination than those in smaller groups. We conclude that rumination behaviour is very plastic and, therefore, that assumptions of uniform rumination rates across individuals may be misleading and may miss an important piece of ruminants' foraging ecology. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","bighorn sheep; chewing behaviour; Ovis canadensis; plasticity; rumination; sex difference; ungulate","activity pattern; body mass; foraging behavior; group size; individual variation; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive status; sex-related difference; sheep; Bovidae; Ovis aries; Ovis canadensis; Ungulata",,,,,,"Bassano, B., Hardenberg, A.V., Pelletier, F., Gobbi, G., A method to weigh free-ranging ungulates without handling (2003) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 31, pp. 1-5; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Dai, B., (2008) lme4: Linear Mixed-effects Models Using S4 Classes, , http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/, R package version 0.999375-27; Bell, R.H.V., The use of the herb layer by grazing ungulates in the Serengeti (1970) Animal Population in Relation to Their Food Resources, pp. 111-123. , Watson A.

In such groups, being able to identify and differentially cooperate with relatives can bring indirect fitness benefits to helpers. We investigated the kin recognition abilities of the cooperatively breeding African cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, while controlling for familiarity between individuals. When given a choice of associating with unfamiliar kin or unfamiliar nonkin, juvenile N. pulcher spent significantly longer associating with kin. Although both chemical and visual cues were required to stimulate the fish, chemical cues were more important than visual cues in kin recognition in this species. As all stimulus fish were reared separately from the focal fish, we can also conclude that N. pulcher used phenotype matching rather than familiarity to assess relatedness to other individuals. Furthermore, when given the choice of associating with familiar over unfamiliar kin, N. pulcher showed no significant preference. Hence, relatedness rather than familiarity appears to be more important in the association preferences of N. pulcher. This is advantageous, particularly if familiar individuals within the cooperatively breeding group are not necessarily relatives. In highly social species such as N. pulcher, being able to recognize kin can bring fitness advantages through kin selection and inbreeding avoidance. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chemical cue; cichlid; familiarity; kin selection; Lake Tanganyika; Neolamprologus pulcher; odour","breeding population; chemical cue; cichlid; cooperative breeding; familiarity; fitness; inbreeding avoidance; kin recognition; kin selection; lake ecosystem; odor; phenotype; visual cue; East African Lakes; Lake Tanganyika; African cichlids; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher",,,,,,"Arnold, K.E., Kin recognition in rainbowfish (Melanotaenia eachamensis): sex, sibs and shoaling (2000) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48, pp. 385-391; Balshine-Earn, S., Lotem, A., Individual recognition in a cooperatively breeding cichlid: evidence from video playback experiments (1998) Behaviour, 135, pp. 369-386; Balshine-Earn, S., Neat, F.C., Reid, H., Taborsky, M., Paying to stay or paying to breed?

Although some males can mate without offering a prey, the gift in this species is thought to represent male mating effort. Male gift offering has been recently described in Paratrechalea ornata, a Neotropical spider belonging to another family, Trechaleidae. We investigated the function of the gift in this species by testing the mating effort hypothesis and two other nonexclusive hypotheses, sexual cannibalism avoidance and paternal investment. Two groups of males were exposed to virgin females: 23 males with no prey (NP group) and 21 males carrying a prey (CP group). Mating success, courtship, copulation and first oviposition were recorded. Males from group CP had better mating success, longer copulations and longer palpal insertions than those from NP. Longer copulations were associated with earlier eggsac construction and oviposition. Some unmated males from NP wrapped prey carrion when they returned to their breeding jars after the trial. Our findings suggest that nuptial gift giving represents male mating effort for P. ornata. Nuptial gifts would allow males to control copulation duration and to accelerate female oviposition, improving sperm supply and paternity, and minimizing possible costs of remating with polyandrous females. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","male mating effort; oviposition acceleration; Paratrechalea ornata; sexual selection; spider nuptial gift","cannibalism; copulation; hypothesis testing; male behavior; nuptial gift; oviposition; prey availability; reproductive cost; reproductive effort; reproductive success; sexual selection; spider; Araneae; Mirabilis; Pisaura mirabilis; Pisauridae",,,,,,"Albo, M.J., Costa-Schmidt, L.E., Costa, F.G., To feed or to wrap?

Although several experiments have demonstrated that short-term food deprivation causes a temporary increase in aggression, no study has, to our knowledge, experimentally manipulated overall food supplies and considered long-term effects on chick behaviour and life history traits. We provided supplemental food to breeding pairs of black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla, over an entire breeding season and compared the aggressive behaviour of their chicks with that of chicks of control pairs. Control A-chicks (first to hatch) showed more frequent and intense aggression than their experimental counterparts. Furthermore, the more A-chicks begged and the lower their growth rate the more aggressive they were. The consequences of increased aggression for B-chicks (second to hatch) were lower begging rate, lower growth rate and lower survival. We thus provide evidence that a sustained increase in food availability affects broodmate aggression and chick survival at the nest and we discuss the various proximate and ultimate causes involved in the evolution of broodmate aggression. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","black-legged kittiwake; brood reduction; broodmate aggression; food amount hypothesis; food supplementation; Rissa tridactyla; siblicide","aggression; breeding population; breeding season; brood size; evolutionary biology; food limitation; food supplementation; growth rate; life history trait; mating behavior; seabird; sexual conflict; siblicide; survival; Rissa tridactyla",,,,,,"Barrett, R.T., Rikardsen, F., Chick growth, fledging periods and adult mass loss of Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica during years of prolonged food stress (1992) Colonial Waterbirds, 15, pp. 24-32; Braun, B.M., Hunt, G.L., Brood reduction in black-legged kittiwakes (1983) Auk, 100, pp. 469-476; Cook, M.I., Monaghan, P., Burns, M.D., Effects of short-term hunger and competitive asymmetry on facultative aggression in nestling black guillemots Cepphus grylle (2000) Behavioral Ecology, 11, pp. 282-287; Coulson, J.C., Differences in quality of birds nesting in centre and on edges of a colony (1968) Nature, 217, pp. 478-479; delaMora, A.N., Drummond, H., Wingfield, J.C., Hormonal correlates of dominance and starvation-induced aggression in chicks of the blue-footed booby (1996) Ethology, 102, pp. 748-761; Drummond, H., The control and function of agonism in avian broodmates (2001) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 30, pp. 261-301; Drummond, H., A revaluation of the role of food in broodmate aggression (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 517-526; Drummond, H., Begging versus aggression in avian broodmate competition (2002) The Evolution of Begging: Competition, Cooperation and Communication, pp. 337-360. , Wright J., and Leonard M.L.

Theory predicts that individuals that are different in appearance to the rest of the group are at a greater risk of predation because they are more conspicuous to predators (the 'oddity' effect). Thus, animals should choose group mates that are the most similar in appearance to themselves. Another common antipredator tactic is crypsis (camouflage). Fishes are capable of changing colour to match their visual background, but few studies have examined how this might influence shoaling decisions, particularly in the context of the oddity effect. We induced colour pattern changes in a colourful species of freshwater fish, the western rainbowfish, Melanotaenia australis, by maintaining fish in dark and pale aquaria for 2 weeks. Analysis of the proportion of black body pigmentation confirmed that rainbowfish in dark environments developed darker colour patterns than those held in pale environments. We then conducted behavioural observations to determine whether fish subsequently based their shoaling decisions on body coloration. We found that rainbowfish preferred to shoal with similar individuals; fish that had been held in dark aquaria preferred to shoal with other dark fish and fish from pale aquaria preferred other pale fish. Our findings are consistent with the predictions of the oddity effect and demonstrate how morphological colour pattern changes and behavioural decisions interact to mediate antipredator tactics in fish. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","colour; colour change; Melanotaenia australis; oddity; rainbowfish; shoaling; social behaviour","antipredator defense; color morph; crypsis; decision making; freshwater ecosystem; group behavior; mimicry; morphology; paleoenvironment; pigment; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; teleost; Animalia; Melanotaenia; Pisces",,,,,,"Allen, G., Midgely, S., Allen, M., (2002) Guide to the Freshwater Fishes of Australia, , Western Australian Museum, Perth; Arnold, K.E., Kin recognition in rainbowfish (Melanotaenia eachamensis): sex, sibs and shoaling (2000) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48, pp. 385-391; Bagnara, J.T., Hadley, M.E., (1973) Chromatophores and Color Change, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Bennett, A.T.D., Cuthill, I.C., Norris, K.J., Sexual selection and the mismeasure of color (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 848-860; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principles of Animal Communication, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts; Brown, C. 1999.

Although a signaller may increase the likelihood of survival for group members, which typically include kin and mates, there are inherent risks associated with any behaviour that increases conspicuousness to predators. Callers can increase their indirect benefits by calling only in the presence of an appropriate audience and manage concomitant costs by judicious investment. Possible tactics for controlling costs include facultative variation in call structure and timing, as well as sensitivity to the environmental and social factors that predict personal vulnerability. We examined individual variation in the alarm-calling behaviour of male fowl in naturalistic social groups. Previous studies of cost management have focused on variation at the level of alarm call rate. We took advantage of recent advances in wireless sound recording and remote video monitoring to test for more subtle variation in signal structure and timing. These were then mapped onto individual mating success and moment-to-moment changes in environmental and social context. Results replicate the previous finding that alarm calling is sensitive to both social rank and recent mating success. In addition, we detected systematic variation in call structure as a function of personal vulnerability and proximity to a rival male. The frequency bandwidth of alarms was reliably influenced by degree of vigilance prior to calling, suggesting that this acoustic dimension reflects motivational state. Taken together, these results reveal several novel tactics for risk management, complementing those previously described at the level of gross variation in alarm-calling behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alarm call; antipredator behaviour; communication network; fowl; Gallus gallus; judicious risk taking; kin selection; referential signal; signal design",,,,,,,,"Smith, C.L.; Centre for the Integrative Study of Animal Behaviour, Department of Brain, Behaviour and Evolution,email: klynn.smith@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.013,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

In a simultaneous choice test, the majority of females remated with familiar males rather than novel males. Mating also lasted longer with familiar males. In a second experiment, monogamous females lived longer than polyandrous females. Although there was no significant difference in egg production between monogamous and polyandrous females, the former produced more viable eggs, with a higher hatching rate.

We evaluated performance of the whistles produced by different males and examined whether individuals improved their performance over consecutive seasons. Finally, we tested whether the performance of whistles reflected males' philopatry and harem size. We assessed whistle performance based on duration and consistency. Our analyses showed that great reed warbler males improved the performance of their whistles in subsequent seasons. Whistles became both longer and more consistent from one year to the next. We also found that males' harem size was significantly related to whistle performance, which in turn reflected philopatry. Subsequent analyses revealed that the performances of polygynous and philopatric males differed significantly from those of monogamous, unpaired and new males. As philopatry is preferred by great reed warbler females, it is in the males' interest to advertise this feature. Coding philopatry in the songs of individual males seems to be an easy and efficient way of informing females about males' familiarity with the breeding grounds. The proper performance of difficult double-element whistles, the mastery of which may be time consuming, seems to be a good candidate for indicating males' philopatry. If so, the quality of whistle syllables may also reflect differences in the general quality of individual males as high performance levels may be associated with both males' longevity and their ability to learn. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Acrocephalus arundinaceus; great reed warbler; philopatry; syllable performance; vocal behaviour",,,,,,,,"Wegrzyn, E.; Department of Zoology, University of Rzeszow, Polandemail: wegrzyn@amu.edu.pl",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.012,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

However, the successful development of parasitic eggs depends on appropriate timing in relation to the host's own eggs. A detailed documentation of CBP requires full knowledge of parentage. We achieved this in a captive population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, breeding in aviaries. The overall frequency of CBP was relatively high (21% of all host clutches, 5.4% of all eggs in host clutches) and comparable to what has been found in the wild in this species. A large proportion of paired females adopted a mixed strategy, laying one or two additional eggs in other nests before initiating their own clutches. Females showed a high individual consistency in whether they adopted a pure nonparasitic strategy or a mixed strategy, which is indicative of individual specialization. About 38% of all eggs laid outside a pair's own nest were incubated by host pairs and can thus be considered successfully parasitic. No paired females were purely parasitic but unpaired females used CBP as a best of a bad job strategy. Hosts were targeted during the early phase of clutch initiation with the majority of parasitic eggs laid 0-5 days before the onset of incubation and usually before the host commenced egg laying. We did not find evidence that particular types of host females were targeted. The within-female repeatability of being a host was estimated to be negative. Overall, the systematic temporal patterns indicate targeted CBP behaviour in zebra finches. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","clutch size; egg dumping; egg-laying pattern; host selection; intraspecific brood parasitism; public information; quasiparasitism; reproductive strategy; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch",,,,,,,,"Schielzeth, H.; Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Germanyemail: holger.schielzeth@ebc.uu.se",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.006,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

In some species nutrient balance may be possible by selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant foreparts (heads, thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant foreparts. Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the gaster and the foreparts, but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants, spiders fed significantly more on the foreparts than on the gaster. Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of the three species revealed that there were more lipids in the gaster, while the foreparts contained more proteins. Our results suggest that ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","development; diet; myrmecophagy; nutrient; performance; spider; Zodarion rubidum",,,,,,,,"Pekár, S.; Department of Botany and Zoology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Czech Republicemail: pekar@sci.muni.cz",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.002,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Our study tested whether developmental stress affects the mate choice behaviour of female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when choosing between potential mates. In an experiment manipulating developmental condition, female zebra finches were raised under nutritional stress or control conditions. In adulthood, female preferences were assessed using extensive four-stimulus mate choice trials. Nutritional stress affected growth rates during the period of stress, with experimentally stressed females lighter than controls. During mate choice trials stressed females were almost three times less active than controls and made fewer sampling visits to the stimulus males, although we found no evidence of a direct effect of developmental experience on which males were preferred. Thus, developmental experience had a clear effect on behavioural patterns in a mate choice context. To test whether this effect is specific to a mate choice context, we also investigated the effect of developmental stress on female activity rates in three social contexts: isolation, contact with a conspecific male (a potential mate) and contact with a conspecific female. Here, female activity did not differ between the experimental treatments in any of the social situations. Overall, our findings suggest that environmental conditions during early development can have long-term context-dependent consequences for adult female mate choice behaviour, mediated by changes in activity rates. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","developmental stress; early environment; female choice; mate choice; mating preference; sexual selection; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch",,,,,,,,"Woodgate, J.L.; Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, U.K.email: joe.woodgate@bristol.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.018,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

We found that more males were attracted to shoals that contained receptive females than to shoals of nonreceptive females or males. We also conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how males use olfactory cues of nonreceptive and receptive females to search for and associate with females. We gave males the option to associate with nonreceptive females when olfactory cues of receptive or nonreceptive females were present and absent, and when olfactory cues were presented alone. Males associated with females most strongly when both cues were presented simultaneously, but when cues were presented separately males' association with females differed with respect to the olfactory cues that were added. Males associated with females equally with visual and olfactory cues presented separately when the odour cues were from receptive females. However, when the odour cues were from nonreceptive females, males associated with females less with olfactory than visual cues. Searching activity increased when males had access only to olfactory cues. Taken together these results suggest that olfactory cues influence males' association with females and searching behaviour, and these changes in behaviour are likely to maximize a male's opportunity to encounter receptive females. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alternative tactics; association preference; female pheromone; guppy; mate searching; olfactory cue; Poecilia reticulata; receptive female; sexual selection",,,,,,,,"Guevara-Fiore, P.; Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, U.K.email: p.guevara.fiore@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.027,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

However, in spite of the extensive literature on theoretical analyses and empirical studies of social learning, little attention has been given to whether individuals acquire knowledge from a single individual or multiple models. Researchers commonly refer to instances of sons learning from fathers, or daughters from mothers, while theoreticians have constructed models of uniparental transmission, with little consideration of whether such restricted modes of transmission are actually feasible. We used mathematical models to demonstrate that the conditions under which learning from a single cultural parent can lead to stable culture are surprisingly restricted (the same reasoning applies to a single social-learning event). Conversely, we demonstrate how learning from more than one cultural parent can establish culture, and find that cultural traits will reach a nonzero equilibrium in the population provided the product of the fidelity of social learning and the number of cultural parents exceeds 1.

Consequently, we investigated this issue with reference to fight structure in fallow deer contests. Support for the individual quality hypothesis was limited: males with larger necks as determined by prerut neck girth fought for longer than males with smaller necks. However, prime-aged males had higher investment in fighting than preprime- or postprime-aged males indicating that investment in fighting might be age related. Other aspects of our results also failed to support condition-related predictions; although we found that jump clashing and vocal rate were related to weight loss and decline in neck girth, respectively, there was no relationship between investment in fighting and prerut measures of body size.

When this phenomenon, known as 'auditory induction', occurs, listeners experience the illusion of hearing an ongoing sound continuing through the interrupting noise even though the perceived sound is not physically present. Such illusions suggest that a key function of the auditory system is to allow listeners to perceive complete auditory objects with incomplete acoustic information, as may often be the case in multisource acoustic environments. At present, however, we know little about the possible functions of auditory induction in the sound-mediated behaviours of animals. The present study used two-choice phonotaxis experiments to test the hypothesis that female grey treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, experience the illusory perceptual restoration of discrete pulses in the male advertisement call when pulses are deleted and replaced by a potential masking noise. While added noise restored some attractiveness to calls with missing pulses, there was little evidence to suggest that the frogs actually experienced the illusion of perceiving the missing pulses. Instead, the added noise appeared to function as an acoustic appendage that made some calls more attractive than others as a result of sensory biases, the expression of which depended on the temporal order and acoustic structure of the added appendages. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","auditory grouping; auditory induction; auditory scene analysis; continuity illusion; gray treefrog; perceptual restoration; phonemic restoration; sensory bias; temporal induction",,,,,,,,"Bee, M.A.; Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, U.S.A.email: mbee@umn.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.004,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Greylag geese are relatively small brained, but live in complex societies with social support and clan structures. They form dominance hierarchies in which families dominate pairs and unpaired individuals. However, competition is costly and the ability to transitively infer relationships among flock members may be highly advantageous. We tested five free-living, juvenile greylag geese embedded in a flock of 150 birds for their ability to track multiple dyadic relationships and their transitive inference competence. Individuals were trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five implicitly ordered colours (A-E). All individuals learned to track four dyadic relationships simultaneously and showed transitive inference when presented with nonadjacent colours. Remarkably, the amount of training required was related to the individual's early social environment. Our study is one of the first to show transitive inference in a precocial bird and suggests an influence of early social experience on sociocognitive abilities. Furthermore, it improves our understanding of social complexity as an important selection pressure for the evolution of cognition. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Anser anser; cognition; greylag goose; social complexity; transitive inference",,,,,,,,"Weiß, B.M.; Konrad Lorenz Forschungsstelle, Grünau, Austriaemail: brigitte.weiss@klf.ac.at",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.029,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Social behaviour is likely to change throughout an individual's life, resulting in different social roles at different ages. Individuals may also choose to interact differently with others based on their age, sex or kinship. We used social network analysis to examine biological correlates of individual social variation in free-living groups of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. To measure social variation, we chose network measures that reflect an individual's tendency to initiate or receive both direct and indirect interactions. We asked how age, sex and kinship influenced patterns of affiliative (socially cohesive) and agonistic (socially competitive) interactions. Specifically, we predicted that individuals would vary in their tendency to initiate and receive interactions according to these characteristics, and that they would be more likely to interact affiliatively with more similar individuals and to interact agonistically with more dissimilar individuals. We found that patterns of direct and indirect interactions changed significantly with age, with younger animals being more involved in affiliative interactions and older animals initiating more agonistic ones. Furthermore, affiliative networks tended to be structured by age and kinship. Our results suggest that yearling yellow-bellied marmots are more important for maintaining social cohesion than has previously been recognized, and that marmot colonies are largely organized based on age group and kinship. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","affiliation; agonism; development; kinship; network; social structure",,,,,,,,"Wey, T.W.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, U.S.A.email: twey@ucla.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.008,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Horses fulfil a wide variety of roles for humans and have been domesticated for at least 5000 years but their ability to read human cues has not been widely studied. We tested the ability of 28 horses to attend to human-given cues in an object choice task. We included five different cues: distal sustained pointing, momentary tapping, marker placement, body orientation and gaze (head) alternation. Horses were able to use the pointing and marker placement cues spontaneously but not the tapping, body orientation and gaze alternation cues. The overall pattern of responding suggests that horses may use cues that provide stimulus enhancement at the time of choice and do not have an understanding of the communicative nature of the cues given. As such, their proficiency at this task appears to be inferior to that of domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, but similar to that of domestic goats, Caprus hircus. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","domestication; Equus caballus; horse; interspecific communication; marker cue; pointing; social cognition",,,,,,,,"Proops, L.; Mammal Vocal Communication and Cognition Research, School of Psychology, University of Sussex, U.K.email: l.c.proops@sussex.ac.uk",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.015,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

These physiologically demanding song displays are often produced in long bouts and are known to be important in intra- and intersexual interactions and to affect male mating success. The acoustic component of these multimodal signals has been extensively studied, but there is little or no published data on the visual part of these displays. We made audiovisual recordings of males (N = 9) directing song displays at male and female conspecifics, and based on inspection of playback of these recordings, we identified five major visual components of the display and quantified variation in these components using a scoring system. We calculated total display scores for male- and female-directed displays and found significant differences based on social context, with the most intense displays being directed at males. The extent of differences in display scores suggests that male- and female-directed displays may represent distinct signals and not a single signal of varying intensity. Although we are the first to report and quantify these differences, they are not unexpected because other than in the context of species identification, the function and information content of male- versus female-directed sexual signals are not predicted to be congruent. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","audiovisual; brown-headed cowbird; communication; Molothrus ater; multimodal; sexual selection; signal; social",,,,,,,,"O'Loghlen, A.L.; Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.A.email: ologhlen@lifesci.ucsb.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.03.001,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Consequently, investigating factors that promote individual participation in intergroup contests should prove useful for understanding how cooperation may persist in animal societies despite cheating. Here, we examined variables affecting individual participation in naturally occurring conflicts between groups of free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. The overall proportion of cooperating group members decreased significantly with an increasing number of group members present. In one pack, the individual probability of active participation decreased significantly when this pack had a numerical advantage over opponents. Dogs belonging to the smallest pack tended to be more cooperative than those belonging to larger groups. Social prestige (measured as the number of submissions received during greeting) did not appear to be a consequence of cooperative behaviour. Individual participation increased with an increasing number of affiliative partners. Young and high-ranking dogs tended to cooperate more when their group was outnumbered by opponents but did not stay at the front of the pack during conflicts. These results emphasize the greater opportunity for cheating in larger groups and the complexity of dogs' behaviour. Cooperation appears to be conditional on both the 'adversity of the environment' (as measured by relative group size) and the identity/behaviour of companions. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","affiliative relationship; Canis lupus familiaris; cheating; cooperation; domestic dog; handicap principle; kin selection; mutualism; natural intergroup conflict; reciprocity","aggression; canid; cheating behavior; cooperative behavior; domestic species; group size; kin selection; mutualism; reciprocity; Animalia; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Bekoff, M., Scent-marking by free-ranging domestic dogs (1979) Biology of Behavior, 4, pp. 123-139; Boesch, C., Boesch, H., Hunting behavior of wild chimpanzee in the Tai National Park (1989) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 78, pp. 547-573; Boitani, L., Francisci, F., Ciucci, P., Andreoli, G., Population biology and ecology of feral dogs in central Italy (1995) The Domestic Dog: Its Evolution, Behaviour and Interactions with People, pp. 217-244. , Serpell J.

We studied prospecting behaviour in the colonial lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, using detailed information from radiomarked individuals, whose breeding attempts we terminated at the chick stage, and intensive videotape recording of nests. Half of the radiomarked individuals actively prospected nests in both their own and foreign colonies and they visited colonies up to 7400 m away from their own breeding colony. The presence and number of prospectors arriving at a given nest were influenced by parameters at both the colony and the nest scale. Prospector visits per nest increased with colony productivity and decreased with colony size. The latter does not necessarily mean that prospectors avoid large colonies but rather may be consequence of a dilution effect in colonies where more potential nests can be prospected. The number of prospectors attracted per nest was positively associated with colony connectivity, indicating that both high spatial colony isolation and a small number of breeding pairs in nearby colonies reduced the arrival of prospectors at a given nest. Finally, prospector visits per nest increased and then decreased with parental feeding rates, indicating this parental activity can attract prospectors up to a certain threshold at which nest owners visit their nests frequently enough to keep prospectors away. Overall, this study suggests that prospecting is the mechanism of acquiring public information that could ultimately determine breeding dispersal decisions and the growth and dynamics observed in breeding aggregations. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","dispersal; Falco naumanni; habitat selection; lesser kestrel; nest visiting; public information","aggregation behavior; breeding site; colonial breeding; colony structure; habitat selection; raptor; Falco naumanni",,,,,,"Aparicio, J.M., Bonal, R., Effects of food supplementation and habitat selection on timing of lesser kestrel breeding (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 873-877; Aparicio, J.M., Cordero, P.J., The effects of the minimum threshold condition for breeding on offspring sex-ratio adjustment in the lesser kestrel (2001) Evolution, 55, pp. 1188-1197; Aparicio, J.M., Bonal, R., Muñoz, A., Experimental test on public information use in the colonial lesser kestrel (2007) Evolutionary Ecology, 21, pp. 783-800; Arcese, P., Age, intrusion pressure and defence against floaters by territorial male song sparrows (1987) Animal Behaviour, 35, pp. 773-784; Bonal, R., Aparicio, J.M., An experimental test of offspring recognition in the colonial lesser kestrel Falco naumanni (2009) Ibis, 151, pp. 577-579; Boulinier, T., Danchin, E., The use of conspecific reproductive success for breeding patch selection in terrestrial migratory species (1997) Evolutionary Ecology, 11, pp. 505-517; Boulinier, T., Danchin, E., Monnat, J.Y., Doutreland, C., Cadiou, B., Timing of prospecting and the value of information in a colonial breeding bird (1996) Journal of Avian Biology, 27, pp. 252-256; Boulinier, T., McCoy, K.D., Yoccoz, N.G., Gasparini, J., Tveraa, T., Public information affects breeding dispersal in a colonial bird: kittiwakes cue on neighbours (2008) Biology Letters, 4, pp. 538-540; Bradley, J.S., Gunn, B.M., Skira, I.J., Meathrel, C.E., Wooller, R.D., Age-dependent prospecting and recruitment to a breeding colony of short-tailed shearwaters Puffinus tenuirostris (1999) Ibis, 141, pp. 277-285; Brown, C.R., Brown, M.B., (1996) Coloniality in the Cliff Swallow: the Effect of Group Size on Behavior, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Brown, C.R., Brown, M.B., Danchin, E., Breeding habitat selection in cliff swallows: the effect of conspecific reproductive success on colony choice (2000) Journal of Animal Ecology, 69, pp. 133-142; Brown, C.R., Brown, M.B., Brazeal, K.R., Familiarity with breeding habitat improves daily survival in colonial cliff swallows (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1201-1210; Bruinzeel, L.W., van de Pol, M., Site attachment of floaters predicts success in territory acquisition (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 290-296; Cadiou, B., Attendance of breeders and prospectors reflects the quality of colonies in the kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (1999) Ibis, 141, pp. 321-326; Cadiou, B., Monnat, J.Y., Danchin, E., Prospecting in the kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla different behavioural patterns and the role of squatting in recruitment (1994) Animal Behaviour, 47, pp. 847-856; Calabuig, G., Ortego, J., Aparicio, J.M., Cordero, P.J., Public information in selection of nesting colony by lesser kestrels: which cues are used and when are they obtained?

Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal personality; behavioural syndrome; blue tit; Cyanistes caeruleus; exploration; neophobia; risk responsiveness","behavioral response; captivity; foraging behavior; passerine; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Cyanistes caeruleus",,,,,,"Apfelbeck, B., Raess, M., Behavioural and hormonal effects of social isolation and neophobia in a gregarious bird species, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (2008) Hormones and Behavior, 54, pp. 435-441; Arnold, K.E., Ramsay, S.L., Donaldson, C., Adam, A., Parental prey selection affects risk-taking behaviour and spatial learning in avian offspring (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 2563-2569; Bell, A.M., Behavioural differences between individuals and two populations of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 464-473; Bell, A.M., Sih, A., Exposure to predation generates personality in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 828-834; Boogert, N.J., Reader, S.M., Laland, K.N., The relation between social rank, neophobia and individual learning in starlings (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 1229-1239; Briffa, M., Rundle, S.D., Fryer, A., Comparing the strength of behavioural plasticity and consistency across situations: animal personalities in the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 275, pp. 1305-1311; Brown, C., Jones, F., Braithwaite, V., In situ examination of boldness-shyness traits in the tropical poeciliid, Brachyraphis episcopi (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 1003-1009; Butler, S.J., Whittingham, M.J., Quinn, J.L., Cresswell, W., Time in captivity, individual differences and foraging behaviour in wild-caught chaffinches (2006) Behaviour, 143, pp. 535-548; Campbell, D.L.M., Weiner, S.A., Starks, P.T., Hauber, M.E., Context and control: behavioural ecology experiments in the laboratory (2009) Annales Zoologici Fennici, 46, pp. 112-123; Clark, A.B., Ehlinger, T.J., Pattern and adaptation in individual behavioral differences (1987) Perspectives in Ethology. 4th edn, pp. 1-47. , Bateson P.P.G., and Klopfer P.H.

We first examined whether the parents were able to distinguish their own familiar related offspring at the age of weaning from unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Both male and female parents, when encountering unfamiliar unrelated juveniles in a neutral arena, showed significantly more agonistic behaviour than when encountering their own familiar offspring, which suggested that adult Brandt's voles might be able to discriminate their own familiar descendants from unfamiliar unrelated ones. Second, we used cross-fostering to investigate the underlying parent-offspring recognition mechanism. Both males and females showed more amicable behaviour and less agonistic behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring. Males showed significantly more amicable behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring, and significantly less agonistic behaviour to familiar unrelated offspring than to unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Remarkably, females showed less agonistic behaviour to familiar related offspring than to unfamiliar related offspring. Furthermore, males and females did not show a significant difference in amicable or agonistic behaviour between familiar related and familiar unrelated offspring or between unfamiliar related and unfamiliar unrelated offspring. Our results suggest that the mechanism of parent-offspring discrimination in Brandt's voles could be familiarity. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Brandt's vole; cross-fostering; dyadic encounter; familiarity; Lasiopodomys brandti; parent-offspring recognition","agonistic behavior; familiarity; parent-offspring interaction; rodent; Lasiopodomys; Muridae",,,,,,"Aldhous, P., The effects of individual cross-fostering on the development of intrasexual kin discrimination in male laboratory mice, Mus musculus L (1989) Animal Behaviour, 37, pp. 741-750; Bateson, P.P.G., Optimal outbreeding (1983) Mate Choice, pp. 257-277. , Bateson P.P.G.

We found that individuals in human groups were capable of identifying those with information, and this identification increased group performance: the speed and accuracy of groups in reaching a target. Using video analysis we found how informed individuals might have been identified by other group members by means of inadvertent social cues (such as starting order, time spent following and group position). Furthermore, we were able to show that at least one of these cues, the group position of informed individuals, was indeed correlated with group performance. Our final experiment confirmed that leadership was even more efficient when the group members were given the identity of the leader. We discuss the effect of information status regarding the presence and identity of leaders on collective animal behaviour. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","collective animal behaviour; group; human; inadvertent social cue; information; leadership","food availability; group behavior; human behavior; information system; leadership; predator; social development; Animalia",,,,,,"Able, K.P., Bingman, V.P., The development of orientation and navigation behavior in birds (1987) Quarterly Review of Biology, 62, pp. 1-29. , 10.1086/415265; Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with Image (2004) Journal of Biophotonics International, 11, pp. 36-42; Bekoff, M., Vigilance, flock size, and flock geometry: information gathering by western evening grosbeaks (Aves, Fringillidae) (1995) Ethology, 99, pp. 150-161; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, B, 57, pp. 289-300; Boinski, S., Campbell, A.F., Use of trill vocalizations to coordinate troop movement among white-faced capuchins: a 2nd field-test (1995) Behaviour, 132, pp. 875-901. , 10.1163/156853995X00054; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principles of Animal Communication, , Sinauer, Sutherland, Massachusetts; Camazine, S., Visscher, P.K., Finley, J., Vetter, R.S., House-hunting by honey bee swarms: collective decisions and individual behaviors (1999) Insectes Sociaux, 46, pp. 348-360. , 10.1007/s000400050156; Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., James, R., Ruxton, G.D., Franks, N.R., Collective memory and spatial sorting in animal groups (2002) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 218, pp. 1-11. , 10.1006/jtbi.2002.3065; Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., Franks, N.R., Levin, S.A., Effective leadership and decision-making in animal groups on the move (2005) Nature, 433, pp. 513-516. , 10.1038/nature03236; Dall, S.R.X., Giraldeau, L.A., Olsson, O., McNamara, J.M., Stephens, D.W., Information and its use by animals in evolutionary ecology (2005) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 20, pp. 187-193. , 10.1016/j.tree.2005.01.010; Danchin, E., Giraldeau, L.A., Valone, T.J., Wagner, R.H., Public information: from nosy neighbors to cultural evolution (2004) Science, 305, pp. 487-491. , 10.1126/science.1098254; Dodson, J.J., The nature and role of learning in the orientation and migratory behavior of fishes (1988) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 23, pp. 161-182. , 10.1007/BF00004908; Dyer, J.R.G., Ioannou, C.C., Morrell, L.J., Croft, D.P., Couzin, I.D., Waters, D.A., Krause, J., Consensus decision making in human crowds (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 461-470. , 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.05.010; Dyer, J.R.G., Johansson, A., Helbing, D., Couzin, I.D., Krause, J., Leadership, consensus decision making and collective behaviour in humans (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 364, pp. 781-789. , 10.1098/rstb.2008.0233; Galef Jr., B.G., Social transmission of acquired behavior: a discussion of tradition and social learning in vertebrates (1976) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 6, pp. 77-100. , 10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60082-0; Galef Jr., B.G., Giraldeau, L.A., Social influences on foraging in vertebrates: causal mechanisms and adaptive functions (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 3-15. , 10.1006/anbe.2000.1557; Helbing, D., Farkas, I., Vicsek, T., Simulating dynamical features of escape panic (2000) Nature, 407, pp. 487-490. , 10.1038/35035023; Krause, J., Ruxton, G.D., (2002) Living in Groups, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Milgram, S., Bickman, L., Berkowit, L., Note on drawing power of crowds of different size (1969) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 13, pp. 79-82; (2008) R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, , R_Core_Development_Team R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna; Reebs, S.G., Can a minority of informed leaders determine the foraging movements of a fish shoal?

Here we investigated further whether they can learn deceptive tactics to counter a scrounger by first retrieving the smaller of two hidden food baits, and whether they can discriminate between different types of co-forager. Seven subordinate pigs were tested with co-foragers, and also alone, when foraging for two differently sized food baits hidden in two of 12 buckets in a foraging arena. Unlike their co-foragers, the subordinates already knew where the foods were located; co-foragers differed in whether they were scroungers or not. Subordinates did not respond to scrounging with the predicted deceptive tactic of visiting the small bait first. They did, however, lose their overall preference for retrieving the large bait first and increased their foraging speed compared to when foraging with nonscroungers or on their own. The findings suggest the ability to discriminate between different individual co-foragers in domestic pigs, and increasing foraging speed as a way of responding to exploitation by scrounging dominants in competitive foraging situations with several food patches. © 2010.","domestic pig; individual discrimination; social foraging; Sus scrofa; tactical deception","behavioral response; domestic species; foraging behavior; pig; social behavior; Corvida; Primates; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",,,,,,"Barta, Z., Flynn, R., Giraldeau, L.A., Geometry for a selfish foraging group: a genetic algorithm approach (1997) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 264, pp. 1233-1238; Beauchamp, G., Giraldeau, L.A., Patch exploitation in a producer-scrounger system: test of a hypothesis using flocks of spice finches (Lonchura punctulata) (1997) Behavioral Ecology, 8, pp. 54-59; Bugnyar, T., Heinrich, B., Pilfering ravens, Corvus corax, adjust their behaviour to social context and identity of competitors (2006) Animal Cognition, 9, pp. 369-376; Bugnyar, T., Kotrschal, K., Leading a conspecific away from food in ravens, Corvus corax?

In zebrafish, Danio rerio, we investigated whether subjects follow knowledgeable fish escaping from a novel artificial predator, learn this escape response, and maintain the demonstrated escape route and response when knowledgeable fish were removed. A moving 'trawl' net forced fish to escape via one of two equidistant escape routes. Groups of four naïve fish were placed together with demonstrator fish trained to use either one of the two routes. Observers with demonstrators were faster to escape than observers exposed to untrained fish, and were biased towards the demonstrated route, effects that persisted when demonstrators were removed. Thus zebrafish socially learned escape routes and to escape faster from the approaching trawl. To address whether escape responses were stably transmitted, we used a transmission chain with observers becoming demonstrators for further groups of observers, thus simulating three generations of social learning. Escape times remained stable along the transmission chain, but route preferences slowly collapsed. Thus while the escape response per se was reliably socially transmitted, more arbitrary choices such as route choice decayed rapidly over repeated episodes of social learning. Our results suggest pervasive species and population differences in social-learning propensities. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","antipredator behaviour; Danio rerio; escape response; following; group size; route learning; social learning; social transmission; tradition; zebrafish","antipredator defense; cyprinid; escape behavior; freshwater ecosystem; group size; learning; social behavior; Danio rerio",,,,,,"Bates, L., Chappell, J., Inhibition of optimal behavior by social transmission in the guppy depends on shoaling (2002) Behavioral Ecology, 13, pp. 827-831; Bond, A.B., Kamil, A.C., Balda, R.P., Social complexity and transitive inference in corvids (2003) Animal Behaviour, 65, pp. 479-487; Boogert, N.J., Reader, S.M., Hoppitt, W., Laland, K.N., The origin and spread of innovations in starlings (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 1509-1518; Brown, C., Laland, K.N., Social learning of a novel avoidance task in the guppy: conformity and social release (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 41-47; Brown, C., Laland, K.N., Social learning in fishes: a review (2003) Fish and Fisheries, 4, pp. 280-288; Brown, C., Warburton, K., Predator recognition and anti-predator responses in the rainbowfish Melanotaenia eachamensis (1997) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 41, pp. 61-68; Brown, C., Warburton, K., Social mechanisms enhance escape responses in shoals of rainbowfish, Melanotaenia duboulayi (1999) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 56, pp. 455-459; Carlier, P., Lefebvre, L., Ecological differences in social learning between adjacent, mixing, populations of Zenaida doves (1997) Ethology, 103, pp. 772-784; Corten, A., The role of 'conservatism' in herring migrations (2001) Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries, 11, pp. 339-361; Curio, E., Ernst, U., Vieth, W., The adaptive significance of avian mobbing (1978) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 48, pp. 184-202; Day, R.L., MacDonald, T., Brown, C., Laland, K.N., Reader, S.M., Interactions between shoal size and conformity in guppy social foraging (2001) Animal Behaviour, 62, pp. 917-925; Duffy, G.A., Pike, T.W., Laland, K.N., Size-dependent directed social learning in nine-spined sticklebacks (2009) Animal Behaviour, 78, pp. 371-375; Galef Jr., B.G., Why behaviour patterns that animals learn socially are locally adaptive (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1325-1334; Galef Jr., B.G., The adaptive value of social learning: a reply to Laland (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 641-644; Galef Jr., B.G., Giraldeau, L.-A., Social influences on foraging in vertebrates: causal mechanisms and adaptive functions (2001) Animal Behaviour, 61, pp. 3-15; Galef Jr., B.G., Whiskin, E.E., Effects of social and asocial learning on longevity of food-preference traditions (1997) Animal Behaviour, 53, pp. 1313-1322; Gerlai, R., Zebra fish: an uncharted behavior genetic model (2003) Behavior Genetics, 33, pp. 461-468; Gleason, P.E., Weber, P.G., Weber, S.P., Effect of group-size on avoidance-learning in zebra fish, Brachydanio rerio (Pisces-Cyprinidae) (1977) Animal Learning & Behavior, 5, pp. 213-216; Griffin, A.S., Social learning about predators: a review and prospectus (2004) Learning & Behavior, 32, pp. 131-140; Hall, D., Suboski, M.D., Sensory preconditioning and 2nd-order conditioning of alarm reactions in zebra danio fish (Brachydanio rerio) (1995) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 109, pp. 76-84; Hall, D., Suboski, M.D., Visual and olfactory stimuli in learned release of alarm reactions by zebra danio fish (Brachydanio rerio) (1995) Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, 63, pp. 229-240; Helfman, G.S., Schultz, E.T., Social transmission of behavioural traditions in a coral-reef fish (1984) Animal Behaviour, 32, pp. 379-384; Heyes, C.M., Social learning in animals: categories and mechanisms (1994) Biological Reviews, 69, pp. 207-231; Hoppitt, W., Laland, K.N., Social processes influencing learning in animals: a review of the evidence (2008) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 38, pp. 105-165; Kelley, J.L., Evans, J.P., Ramnarine, I.W., Magurran, A.E., Back to school: can antipredator behaviour in guppies be enhanced through social learning?

Anuran amphibians are best known for acoustic communication but visual cues have also been found to play a role. Little is known, however, about visual cues in explosively breeding anurans in which sexual selection is based almost exclusively on male-male competition. During their search for mates, males may not distinguish between the sexes or species and mismating attempts are known to occur. Assuming that mismatings are costly for males, one would expect selection to favour a trait that facilitates sex recognition. We determined the colour of the explosively breeding common frog, Rana temporaria, during reproduction by spectrophotometry. While reflectance of all body parts in both sexes decreased from immigration to spawning, reflectance of male throats increased significantly. The mean luminance of male throats was more than twice that of female throats. Male throats contrasted most against male flanks with luminance contrast being significantly higher than chromatic contrast. In an experiment with individually marked frogs, throat luminance was not correlated with male size, body condition or the physical presence of females, whereas temperature showed a significantly positive effect. Our results give no hint that throats indicate male status or indicate male quality. Considering the high densities during breeding, our results suggest that bright male throats can act as a visual signal among males to facilitate gender recognition and avoid attacks by other males. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","anura; common frog; explosive breeding; luminance contrast; Rana temporaria; sex recognition; visual signal","body condition; body size; frog; intraspecific competition; mating success; sex role; sexual selection; spectrophotometry; visual cue; Amphibia; Anura; Rana temporaria",,,,,,"Amézquita, A., Hödl, W., How, when, and where to perform visual displays: the case of the Amazonian frog Hyla parviceps (2004) Herpetologica, 60, pp. 420-429; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Arak, A., Male-male competition and mate choice in anuran amphibians (1983) Mate Choice, pp. 181-210. , Bateson P.

However, whether genetic quality is directly associated with mating success in humans is unknown. Genetic diversity in general, and particularly at genes important for immune functioning within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), has been associated with individual fitness and opposite-sex preferences for facial appearance, and may therefore be subject to sexual selection in humans. We investigated whether general and/or MHC genetic diversity, measured as microsatellite heterozygosity and standardized mean d<sup>2</sup>, was associated with mating success, defined as number of sexual partners and age of first sex. Both measures of MHC diversity predicted number of sexual partners in females. Females with greater MHC diversity were more successful at obtaining mates than less diverse females. Mating success in males, however, was not significantly associated with any of the genetic diversity measures. These results provide partial support for a role of genetic diversity in human mating success. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","genetic diversity; heterozygosity; human; mating success; mean d<sup>2</sup>; sexual selection","fitness; gene; genetic variation; heterozygosity; human evolution; mating success; sexual selection",,,,,,"Alexander, M.G., Fisher, T.D., Truth and consequences: using the bogus pipeline to examine sex differences in self reported sexuality (2003) Journal of Sex Research, 40, pp. 27-35; Amos, W., Worthington Wilmer, J., Fullard, K., Burg, T.M., Croxall, J.P., Bloch, D., Coulson, T., The influence of parental relatedness on reproductive success (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 268, pp. 2021-2027; Balloux, F., Amos, W., Coulson, T., Does heterozygosity estimate inbreeding in real populations?

However, this particular function of communicative interaction has not previously been found in canids. We provide the first experimental indication that domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, rely on context-dependent signals during interspecific agonistic encounters. We recorded several sequences of growls from dogs in three different contexts: during play, guarding a bone from another dog, and reacting to a threatening stranger. We analysed the acoustic structure of the growls and additionally performed playback tests in a seminatural food-guarding situation. We found that play growls differed acoustically from the other two (agonistic) types of growls, mainly in their fundamental frequencies and formant dispersions. Results of the playback experiment showed that food-guarding growls deterred other dogs from taking away a seemingly unattended bone more effectively than growls recorded in the threatening stranger situation. We ruled out an effect of the signaller's body weight on the subjects' responses. These results provide the first evidence of context specificity of agonistic vocalizations in the dog. We discuss the possible aspects of honesty and deception through acoustic modulation of growls. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustical analysis; Canis familiaris; dog; graded signal; growl; referential communication","body mass; canid; communication behavior; domestic species; vocalization; Canidae; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Boersma, P., Weenik, D., (1996) Praat: a system for doing phonetics by computer, , http://www.praat.org; Cohen, J.A., Fox, M.W., Vocalization in wild canids and possible effects of domestication (1976) Behavioural Processes, 1, pp. 77-92; Crockford, C., Boesch, C., Context-specific calls in wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus: analysis of barks (2003) Animal Behaviour, 66, pp. 115-125; Evans, C.S., Evans, L., Chicken food calls are functionally referential (1999) Animal Behaviour, 58, pp. 307-319; Evans, C.S., Evans, L., Marler, P., On the meaning of alarm calls: functional reference in an avian vocal system (1993) Animal Behaviour, 46, pp. 23-28; Feddersen-Petersen, D.U., Vocalization of European wolves (Canis lupus lupus l.) and various dog breeds (Canis lupus f. familiaris) (2000) Archiv für Tierzucht, Dummerstorf, 43, pp. 387-397; Fischer, J., Barbary macaques categorize shrill barks into two call types (1998) Animal Behaviour, 55, pp. 799-807; Fitch, W.T., The phonetic potential of nonhuman vocal tracts: comparative cineradiographic observations of vocalizing animals (2000) Phonetica, 57, pp. 205-218; Fitch, W.T., Reby, D., The descended larynx is not uniquely human (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 268, pp. 1669-1675; Hauser, M.D., (1996) The Evolution of Communication, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Hauser, M.D., Functional referents and acoustic similarity: field playback experiments with rhesus monkeys (1998) Animal Behaviour, 55, pp. 1647-1658; Hauser, M.D., Marler, P., Food associated calls in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): I.

Even though many studies on species with conventional sex roles have shown that alterations in the OSR can either intensify male-male competition or promote female-female competitive interactions, sometimes resulting in a reversal of sex roles, it is not known how, and how quickly, individuals with reversed sex roles respond to fluctuations in this ratio. We tested for a direct influence of adult sex ratios (as a direct estimation of the OSR) on the reproductive behaviour of the sex role-reversed black striped pipefish, Syngnathus abaster. Although imbalances in the OSR effectively modulated the expression of sex roles, with males and females varying in the degree of choosiness and competitive displays, alterations in the sex ratios did not promote a similar response pattern in both sexes. A surplus of males resulted in a reversion to conventional sex roles observed when both sexes coexist in similar numbers, with males competing intensely and exhibiting a conspicuous ornament towards other males. An excess of females, in contrast, did not result in an overall increase in female competitive interactions. Only small, less attractive, females were more prone to compete as the proportion of males decreased. Large females, however, seemed to rely on their greater mating prospects, thereby avoiding the hypothetical costs of intrasexual competition. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","black striped pipefish; competition; female-female-interaction; mating tactics; operational sex ratio (OSR); sex role reversal; Syngnathidae; Syngnathus abaster","intraspecific competition; intraspecific interaction; marine ecosystem; mating behavior; sex ratio; sex role; sexual selection; teleost; Syngnathidae; Syngnathus abaster",,,,,,"Almada, V.C., Gonçalves, E.J., Oliveira, R.F., Santos, A.J., Courting females: ecological constraints affect sex roles in a natural population of the blenniid fish Salaria pavo (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1125-1127; Berglund, A., Egg competition in a sex-role reversed pipefish: subdominant females trade reproduction for growth (1991) Evolution, 45, pp. 770-774; Berglund, A., The operational sex ratio influences choosiness in a pipefish (1994) Behavioural Ecology, 5, pp. 254-258; Berglund, A., Rosenqvist, G., Male pipefish prefer dominant over attractive females (2001) Behavioral Ecology, 12, pp. 402-406; Berglund, A., Rosenqvist, G., Sex-role reversal in pipefish (2003) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 32, pp. 131-167; Berglund, A., Sandvik, W.M., Rosenqvist, G., Sex-role reversal revisited: choosy females and ornamented, competitive males in a pipefish (2005) Behavioral Ecology, 200, pp. 649-655; Berglund, A., Rosenqvist, G., Robinson-Wolrath, A., Food or sex: males and females in a sex role reversed pipefish have different interests (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, pp. 281-287; Billing, A.M., Rosenqvist, G., Berglund, A., No terminal investment in pipefish males: only young males exhibit risk-prone courtship behavior (2007) Behavioral Ecology, 18, pp. 535-540; Cakic, P., Lenhardt, M., Mickovic, D., Sekulic, N., Budakov, L.J., Biometric analysis of Syngnathus abaster populations (2002) Journal of Fish Biology, 60, pp. 1562-1569; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Sexual selection in males and females (2007) Science, 318, pp. 1882-1885; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Parker, G.A., Potential reproductive rates and the operation of sexual selection (1992) Quaterly Review of Biology, 67, pp. 437-456; Dawson, C.E., Syngnathidae (1986) Fishes of the North-eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, pp. 628-639. , Whitehead P.J.P., Bauchot M.L., Hureau J.C., Nielsen J., and Tortonese E.

Because of differences in genetic architecture, sexually selected traits are expected to suffer stronger inbreeding depression than morphological traits. We used full-sib mating to investigate the effects of inbreeding on viability, attractiveness, morphology and potentially secondary sexual traits in male and female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Unexpectedly, the genetic load from lethal alleles (leading to early mortality) was low. In males, we found strong negative effects of inbreeding on song rate, beak colour, body size and choice chamber attractiveness, whereas body condition, fat deposition, song structure and plumage ornaments were unaffected. In females, beak colour, body size, fat deposition and choice chamber behaviour showed significant inbreeding depression. These results indicate that some but not all adult phenotypes are affected by inbreeding, most probably because of the homozygous expression of slightly deleterious mutations. Our findings complement alternative approaches to study the condition dependence of traits that may be relevant in mate choice or competition. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","condition dependence; genic capture; honest signalling; lethal equivalent; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch","allele; body condition; body size; cyprinid; evolutionarily stable strategy; freshwater ecosystem; honest signaling; inbreeding depression; life history trait; mate choice; morphology; mutation; phenotype; Taeniopygia guttata",,,,,,"Ala-Honkola, O., Uddström, A., Diaz Pauli, B., Lindström, K., Strong inbreeding depression in male mating behaviour in a poeciliid fish (2009) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 22, pp. 1396-1406; Amos, W., Wilmer, J.W., Fullard, K., Burg, T.M., Croxall, J.P., Bloch, D., Coulson, T., The influence of parental relatedness on reproductive success (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 268, pp. 2021-2027; Aspi, J., Inbreeding and outbreeding depression in male courtship song characters in Drosophila montana (2000) Heredity, 84, pp. 273-282; Baayen, R.H., (2008) Analyzing Linguistic Data: a Practical Introduction to Statistics Using R, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Balakrishnan, C.N., Edwards, S.V., Nucleotide variation, linkage disequilibrium and founder-facilitated speciation in wild populations of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) (2009) Genetics, 181, pp. 645-660; Barrett, S.C.H., Charlesworth, D., Effects of a change in the level of inbreeding on the genetic load (1991) Nature, 352, pp. 522-524; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Dai, B., (2008) lme4: linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes, , http://lme4.r-forge.r-project.org/; Bolund, E., Schielzeth, H., Forstmeier, W., Intrasexual competition in zebra finches, the role of beak colour and body size (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 715-724; Bolund, E., Schielzeth, H., Forstmeier, W., No heightened condition dependence of zebra finch ornaments: a quantitative genetic approach (2010) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 23, pp. 586-597; Briskie, J.V., Mackintosh, M., Hatching failure increases with severity of population bottlenecks in birds (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 101, pp. 558-561; Burley, N., Coopersmith, C.B., Bill color preferences of zebra finches (1987) Ethology, 76, pp. 133-151; Burley, N.T., Foster, V.S., Variation in female choice of mates: condition influences selectivity (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 713-719; Carter, A.J.R., Weier, T.M., Houle, D., The effect of inbreeding on fluctuating asymmetry of wing veins in two laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster (2009) Heredity, 102, pp. 563-572; Chapman, J.R., Nakagawa, S., Coltman, D.W., Slate, J., Sheldon, B.C., A quantitative review of heterozygosity-fitness correlations in animal populations (2009) Molecular Ecology, 18, pp. 2746-2765; Charlesworth, D., Charlesworth, B., Inbreeding depression and its evolutionary consequences (1987) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 18, pp. 237-268; Charlesworth, D., Willis, J.H., The genetics of inbreeding depression (2009) Nature Reviews Genetics, 10, pp. 783-796; Chippindale, A.K., Gibson, J.R., Rice, W.R., Negative genetic correlation for adult fitness between sexes reveals ontogenetic conflict in Drosophila (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 98, pp. 1671-1675; Cotton, S., Fowler, K., Pomiankowski, A., Do sexual ornaments demonstrate heightened condition-dependent expression as predicted by the handicap hypothesis?

We tested this hypothesis by collecting young Pomacentrus amboinensis using light traps and settling them onto patch reefs where their behaviour and survivorship were monitored for 24 h. One month later, individuals of the same cohort were collected from shallow reefs and released onto patch reefs where their behaviour and survivorship were monitored for 6 days. At settlement young fish suffered high (60% in 24 h) mortality that preferentially removed larger, faster-growing individuals. However, we could find no evidence that foraging behaviour contributed to this selective mortality. In contrast, 1 month later the same cohort underwent negative size-selective mortality where the smallest, slower-growing fish were preferentially removed by predators. Larger fish spent more time foraging, were more aggressive, swam greater distances and chased more fish than smaller individuals. Thus, consistent individual differences in behaviour contributed to patterns of mortality, but in a way that involved no apparent trade-off with growth. For P. amboinensis, consistent variation in growth may be maintained by spatial and temporal differences in the selective regime within the reef environment.

We define motor performance as vigour, the ability to perform energetically expensive acts repeatedly, or as skill, the ability to perform difficult motor tasks well. Motor performance reflects most aspects of whole-organism performance that relate to survival, and thus should indicate, more reliably than ornaments do, individual male genetic quality and/or developmental history. Male sexual displays in many animal taxa contain elements of vigour and/or skill, and accumulating evidence suggests that females choose mates in nature based upon their evaluations of male motor performance. We note that male ornaments in many species are accompanied by conspicuous motor display, and we propose that ornaments often arise secondarily as a way to enhance the apparent skill or vigour of male motor performance.

To reduce the effects of acoustic interferences from other bats' echolocation calls, we hypothesized that bats might shift the timing of their pulse emissions to minimize temporal overlap with another bat's echolocation pulses. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, echolocating in the laboratory would shift the timing of their own pulse emissions in response to regularly repeating artificial acoustic stimuli. Each bat tested showed a robust phase-locked temporal pattern in pulse emissions that included an initial suppressive phase lasting more than 60 ms after stimulus onset, during which the probability of emitting pulses was reduced by more than 50%, followed by a compensatory rebound phase, the timing and amplitude of which were dependent on the temporal pattern of the stimulus. The responses were nonadapting and were largely insensitive to broad changes in the acoustic properties of the stimulus. Randomly occurring noise bursts also suppressed calling for up to 60 ms, but the time course of the compensatory rebound phase was more rapid than when the bats were responding to regularly repeating patterns of noise bursts. These findings provide the first quantitative description of how external stimuli may cause echolocating bats to alter the timing of subsequent pulse emissions.","acoustic masking; animal communication; bat; echolocation; free-tailed bat; noise; Tadarida brasiliensis; vocalization","bat; communication behavior; echolocation; noise; temporal analysis; vocalization; Animalia; Molossidae; Tadarida brasiliensis",,,,,,"Arlettaz, R., Jones, G., Racey, P.A., Effect of acoustic clutter on prey detection by bats (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 742-745; Bates, M.E., Stamper, S.A., Simmons, J.A., Jamming avoidance response of big brown bats in target detection (2008) Journal of Experimental Biology, 211, pp. 106-113; Bohn, K., Schmidt-French, B., Ma, S.T., Pollak, G.D., Syllable acoustics, temportal patterns, and call composition vary with behavioral context in Mexican free-tailed bats (2008) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 124, pp. 1838-1848; Brumm, H., Signalling through acoustic windows: nightingales avoid interspecific competition by short-term adjustment of song timing (2006) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 192, pp. 1279-1285; Egnor, S.E., Wickelgren, J.G., Hauser, M.D., Tracking silence: adjusting vocal production to avoid acoustic interference (2007) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 193, pp. 477-483; Ficken, R.W., Ficken, M.S., Temporal pattern shifts to avoid acoustic interference in singing birds (1974) Science, 183, pp. 762-763; Gillam, E.H., Ulanovsky, N., McCracken, G.F., Rapid jamming avoidance in biosonar (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 651-660; Gooler, D.M., O'Neill, W.E., The central control of biosonar signal production in bats demonstrated by microstimulation of anterior cingulate cortex in the echolocating bat, Pteronotus parnelli parnelli (1986) The Physiological Control of Mammalian Vocalization, pp. 153-184. , Newman J.D.

Current theory predicts that relationship quality comprises three separate components, its value, compatibility and security. This study is the first to investigate the components of relationship quality in a large-brained bird. Following methods recently used to obtain quantitative measures of each relationship quality component in chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we entered data on seven behavioural variables from a group of 11 ravens, Corvus corax, into a principal components analysis. The characteristics of the extracted components matched those predicted for value, compatibility and security, and were labelled as such. When the effects of kinship and sex combination on each relationship quality component were analysed, we found that kin had more valuable relationships, whereas females had less secure and compatible relationships, although the effect of sex combination on compatibility only applied to nonkin. These patterns are consistent with what little knowledge we have of raven relationships from aviary studies and show that the components of relationship quality in ravens may indeed be analogous to those in chimpanzees. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","compatibility; corvid; Corvus corax; raven; relationship quality; security; social relationship; value","behavioral ecology; kinship; passerine; principal component analysis; social behavior; Aves; Corvida; Corvus corax; Pan; Pan troglodytes",,,,,,"Arnold, K., Fraser, O.N., Aureli, F., Postconflict reconciliation Primates in Perspective, 2. , In press, Ed. by C.

However, their function within the motivational system remains unclear. I tested the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during transitions between motivational states, using the honeybee model system. I observed a number of locomotory and grooming behaviours performed when foraging honeybees returned to the hive to dance. These focal behaviours occurred significantly more frequently during the period of transition from waggle dancing to exiting the hive to forage than during the periods before the waggle dance or during the waggle dance. By contrast, the control behaviour, trophallaxis, was distributed across time periods significantly differently, occurring with equal frequency in all periods. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that displacement activities have a functional role during motivational transitions.

Although there is extensive diversity in nuptial gift form, a gift provided before mating typically serves to facilitate copulation, thereby increasing a male's mating success. Unlike other insects, the Hawaiian swordtail cricket Laupala shows protracted courtship that includes the serial donation of nuptial gifts prior to mating. Males transfer multiple spermless 'micro' spermatophores over several hours before the transfer of a single sperm containing a 'macro' spermatophore. By experimental manipulation of male courtship, we tested several hypotheses pertaining to the adaptive significance of protracted courtship involving nuptial gift donation in this system. We found that extensive courtship interactions improve insemination by causing the female reproductive tract to take in more sperm. This suggests that the enhancement of sperm transfer is due to the serial donation of microspermatophores, which would represent a relatively novel function for nuptial gifts provided before mating and highlights the importance of examining cryptic processes of sexual selection. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","cricket; ejaculate protection; Laupala; mating success; nuptial gift","adaptation; cricket; experimental study; hypothesis testing; mating success; nuptial gift; sexual selection; spermatophore; Hexapoda; Laupala; Laupala cerasina",,,,,,"Bloch Qazi, M.C., Aprille, J.R., Lewis, S.M., Female role in sperm storage in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (1998) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A Molecular & Integrative Physiology, 120, pp. 641-647; Brown, W.D., Gwynne, D.T., Evolution of mating in crickets, katydids and wetas (Ensifera) (1997) The Bionomics of Grasshoppers, Katydids and Their Kin, pp. 281-314. , Gangwere S.K., and Muralirangan M.C.

Several species of birds raise the minimum frequency of vocalizations in urban noise, which is louder at lower frequencies. We recorded 12 species of birds in urban and nonurban environments, and tested whether the extent to which different species raise their minimum frequency is related to the frequency range they use. We found that raising the minimum frequency is common in urban birds and is not restricted to passerine song, but also occurs in other vocalizations of passerines and parrots. There was a strong curvilinear relation between the extent to which urban birds raise the minimum frequency and the typical minimum frequency of the species: species with intermediate minimum frequencies (around 1-1.5 kHz) raised the frequency more than species with either higher or lower minimum frequency. This suggests that high-frequency species, which are less affected by urban noise, do not need to adjust the frequency of vocalizations as much. It also suggests that for species with very low frequencies, in a frequency range where urban noise augments exponentially, increasing frequency may not overcome masking by noise efficiently, and these species may use different adaptations. This indicates that frequency differences between species influence the way in which they respond to the same communication problem (masking by low-frequency noise), and possibly also the subsequent evolution of acoustic signals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic adaptation; urban noise; vocalization frequency","adaptation; behavioral response; passerine; urban area; vocalization; Animalia; Aves; Passeriformes; Psittacidae",,,,,,"Barker, F.K., Barrowclough, G.F., Groth, J.G., A phylogenetic hypothesis for passerine birds: taxonomic and biogeographic implications of an analysis of nuclear DNA sequence data (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 295-308; Barker, F.K., Cibois, A., Schikler, P., Feinstein, J., Cracraft, J., Phylogeny and diversification of the largest avian radiation (2004) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 101, pp. 11040-11045; Bergen, F., Abs, M., Etho-ecological study of the singing activity of the blue tit (Parus caeruleus), great tit (Parus major) and chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) (1997) Journal of Ornithology, 138, pp. 451-467; Bermúdez-Cuamatzin, E., Ríos-Chelén, A.A., Gil, D., Garcia, C.M., Strategies of song adaptation to urban noise in the house finch: syllable pitch plasticity or differential syllable use?

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this reproductive pattern in natural populations, but growing evidence suggests that assortative mating most often results from sexual mating preferences. Recently, condition-dependent mate choice in the face of costly competition for mates has been proposed to explain assortative mating in natural populations. Variation in competitive ability may generate variation in both the strength and the direction of mate preference, resulting in assortative mating with respect to individual quality if low-quality competitors are less choosy, or if high-quality males and females pair up first, leaving low-quality individuals to form pairs between themselves. We investigated individuals' preferences for mates on the basis of differential competitive abilities and size-dependent costs in mate-guarding behaviour in the amphipod Gammarus pulex. Our results show that the presence of an unpaired male close to a pair can induce stress that can lead to pair separation. However, no direct take-over was observed. In our series of male mate choice experiments, under low, high or simulated levels of competition, small males made similar choices. Our results suggest that the frequency of take-overs, and more generally interference competition, can be considered insufficient to induce a reduced preference for large females in this population, and is thus unlikely to explain size-assortative mating. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","assortative pairing; Gammarus pulex; prudent choice; sexual selection","amphibian; assortative mating; freshwater ecosystem; hypothesis testing; mate choice; mate guarding; sexual selection; Amphipoda; Animalia; Crustacea; Gammarus; Gammarus pulex",,,,,,"Adams, J., Greenwood, P.J., Why are males bigger than females in precopula pairs of Gammarus pulex?

However, variation in amplitude may also have signalling value. In songbirds, song amplitude varies considerably between males but little is known about the causes and consequences of this variation. One of the main functions of birdsong is mate attraction, but whether and how amplitude variation (beyond reception thresholds) affects female choice at all is poorly understood, as this parameter is notoriously difficult to measure in the field. However, levels of signal amplitude at the source and at the receiver's end can be reliably controlled under laboratory conditions. Here we addressed the question whether differences in male song amplitude may influence female choice. Song preferences of female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were tested in an operant conditioning task involving sets of four song stimuli, in each case derived from one original song. Within a set, stimuli differed in amplitude or in level of degradation but not in song phonology or syntax. We found that females preferred songs with higher sound pressure level within the tested range of naturally observed amplitude variation regardless of the two reverberation levels. As song preferences are highly predictive of mate choice in this species, our results suggest that female zebra finches may use song amplitude as a criterion in mate choice. This raises the question what information the naturally occurring variation in amplitude between males in this and other songbird species conveys about the singer. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","female song preference; mate choice; operant conditioning; signal degradation; song amplitude; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch","behavioral response; communication behavior; mate attraction; mate choice; songbird; vocalization; Animalia; Passeri; Taeniopygia guttata",,,,,,"Adret, P., Operant conditioning, song learning and imprinting to taped song in the zebra finch (1993) Animal Behaviour, 46, pp. 149-159; Anderson, R.C., Nowicki, S., Searcy, W.A., Soft song in song sparrows: response of males and females to an enigmatic signal (2007) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 61, pp. 1267-1274; Anderson, R.C., Searcy, W.A., Peters, S., Nowicki, S., Soft song in the song sparrow: acoustic structure and implications for signal function (2008) Ethology, 114, pp. 662-676; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Arak, A., Female mate selection in the natterjack toad: active choice or passive attraction?

Time depth recorders (TDR) and other archival tags have been widely used to infer patterns of diving and foraging. However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour in a wide range of animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","autocorrelation; diving; Eudyptes chrysolophus; foraging strategy; macaroni penguin","autocorrelation; behavioral response; bird; foraging behavior; periodicity; time series; Animalia; Eudyptes chrysolophus; Spheniscidae",,,,,,"Ainley, D.G., LeResche, R.E., Sladen, W.J.L., (1983) Breeding Ecology of the Adélie Penguin, , University of California Press, Los Angeles; Alonzo, S.H., Switzer, P.V., Mangel, M., Ecological games in space and time: the distribution and abundance of Antarctic krill and penguins (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 1598-1607; Austin, D., Bowen, W.D., McMillan, J.I., Iverson, S.J., Linking movement, diving, and habitat to foraging success in a large marine predator (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 3095-3108; Baird, R.W., Hanson, M.B., Dill, L.M., Factors influencing the diving behaviour of fish-eating killer whales: sex differences and diel and interannual variation in diving rates (2005) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 83, pp. 257-267; Barlow, K.E., Croxall, J.P., Seasonal and inter-annual variation in foraging range and habitat of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at South Georgia (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 232, pp. 294-304; Berryman, A.A., Turchin, P., Identifying the density-dependent structure underlying ecological time series (2001) Oikos, 92, pp. 265-270; Bjørnstad, O.N., Champely, S., Stenseth, N.C., Saitoh, T., Cyclicity and stability of grey-sided voles, Clethrionomys rufocanus, of Hokkaido: spectral and principal components analysis (1996) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 351, pp. 867-875; Boyd, I.L., Foraging and provisioning in Antarctic fur seals: interannual variability in time-energy budgets (1999) Behavioral Ecology, 10, pp. 198-208; Boyd, I.L., Arnould, J.P.Y., Barton, T., Croxall, J.P., Foraging behaviour of Antarctic fur seals during periods of contrasting prey abundance (1994) Journal of Animal Ecology, 63, pp. 703-713; Boyd, I.L., Stanniland, I.J., Martin, A.R., Spatial distribution of foraging by female Antarctic fur seals (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 242, pp. 285-294; Brack, T., Jubran, A., Tobin, M.J., Effect of resistive loading on variational activity of breathing (1998) American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 157, pp. 1756-1763; Braunstein, J.R., Franke, E.K., Autocorrelation of ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (1961) Circulation Research, 9, pp. 300-304; Burns, J.M., Costa, D.P., Fedak, M.A., Bradshaw, C.J.A., Hindell, M.A., McDonald, G., Trumble, S.J., Crocker, D., Winter habitat use and foraging behavior of crabeater seals along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (2004) Deep-Sea Research Part II, 51, pp. 2279-2303; Crawley, M.J., (2007) The R Book, , J.

Here, we show in a field experiment that the ants are able to locate the nest entrance within a two-dimensional olfactory array. Ants were trained to forage in an open channel and to memorize the nest entrance relative to four odours that were applied at the corners of an invisible quadratic array. In a test situation, the ants pinpointed the fictive nest only when the odours were present at their learned positions. Our results suggest that the ants had learned the olfactory scenery around their nest. Furthermore, unilaterally antennectomized ants could not pinpoint the nest within a two-dimensional array. Hence, this kind of orientation depends on the simultaneous input of both antennae, that is, on a stereo sense of smell. Until now, insects and mammals, including humans, have only been known to use bilateral sensory input to follow a concentration gradient of an odour. Our evidence suggests that desert ants require a stereo sense of smell to make use of the olfactory scenery around their nest for homing. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cataglyphis fortis; desert ant; insect; landmark; navigation; olfaction; stereo smell","ant; odor; olfactory cue; orientation behavior; Animalia; Cataglyphis fortis; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Mammalia",,,,,,"Akesson, S., Wehner, R., Visual navigation in desert ants Cataglyphis fortis: are snapshots coupled to a celestial system of reference?

These relationships, based on repeated interactions, define each partner's expectations during the following encounters. The creation of a relationship implies high social cognitive abilities which require that each partner is able to associate the positive or negative content of an interaction with a specific partner and to recall this association. In this study, we tested the effects of repeated interactions on the memory kept by 23 young horses about humans, after 6 and 8 months of separation. The association of a reward with a learning task in an interactional context induced positive reactions towards humans during training. It also increased contact and interest, not only just after training, but also several months later, despite no further interaction with humans. In addition, this 'positive memory' of humans extended to novel persons. Overall, positive reinforcement enhanced learning and memorization of the task itself. These findings suggest remarkable social cognitive abilities that can be transposed from intraspecific to interspecific social contexts. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Equus caballus; horse; human-animal relationship; learning; memory; positive interaction; social cognition","behavioral response; cognition; horse; learning; memory; Animalia; Equidae; Equus caballus",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Bourjade, M., de Boyer des Roches, A., Hausberger, M., Adult-young ratio, a major factor regulating social behaviour of young: a horse study (2009) PLoS ONE, 4, pp. e4888; Boyd, L., Ontogeny of behavior in Przewalski horses (1988) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 21, pp. 41-69; Boyd, L., Keiper, R., Behavioural ecology of feral horses (2005) The Domestic Horse.

Sleeping sites have been implicated in predator defence and thermoregulation and their distribution can affect breeding and social systems in small mammals. Sleeping sites may constitute a limiting resource for females which experience energetic constraints to breeding and require shelter for their young. Despite the potential importance of sleeping sites, exhaustive studies of the factors determining their usage patterns are limited to a small number of mammal groups. We investigated how seasonal changes in temperature or the presence of young shape sleeping site usage patterns in a small primate, the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. Females preferred tree holes over nests and open sites and the usage duration of a particular tree hole site was affected by the physical characteristics likely to affect its insulation properties. Furthermore, climate variables strongly affected sleeping site choices and nests were chosen more often than tree holes during the wet season. However, when young were present preferences shifted back to tree holes. Preferred tree species used as sleeping sites as well as the properties of tree holes were rare among trees in the study area suggesting that sleeping sites may indeed be a limiting resource for female grey mouse lemurs. Our results suggest that in the study species sleeping site choices are governed by thermoregulatory considerations and their limited availability could also account for the social grouping. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","grey mouse lemur; limiting resource; Microcebus murinus; sleeping site; thermoregulation",,,,,,,,"Lutermann, H.; Institute of Zoology, School of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germanyemail: hlutermann@zoology.up.ac.za",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.017,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

In this study, we examined ejaculate quality and investment in testicular tissue in relation to plumage colour and social status in the genetically promiscuous red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus melanocephalus. In this species, males exhibit one of three alternative reproductive phenotypes during the breeding season: males can breed in red and black plumage, breed in brown plumage, or act as brown-plumed, nonbreeding auxiliaries. We found that red/black breeders invested more heavily in spermatogenic tissue, had larger sperm reserves, and tended to have greater numbers of sperm in ejaculate samples, when compared to brown breeders and auxiliaries. Within red/black breeders, plumage redness and saturation (i.e. long wavelength hue and increased red chroma) were negatively correlated with ejaculate sample sperm density. In addition, ejaculate motility appeared to be related to variation in plumage coloration such that, overall, males with less elaborate ornamentation showed greater ejaculate quality. These results suggest that pre- and postcopulatory traits negatively covary in red/black plumed red-backed fairy-wrens and indicate a possible trade-off between investment in plumage ornaments and investment in ejaculates. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis; sexual competence; sexual selection; sperm competition; sperm quality",,,,,,,,"Rowe, M.; Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, U.S.A.email: melissah.rowe@asu.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.020,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Females of chorusing animals also frequently have preferences for signal timing positions, generally preferring the leading signal. Under natural chorus conditions, females must choose among signals that vary in features as well as relative timing. I conducted playback experiments with female Hyla cinerea treefrogs to evaluate whether one type of preference (for attractive signal feature or attractive timing) dominates the overall attractiveness of a signal, or whether different types of preferences can interact. I found that the overall attractiveness of a signal was determined by a combination of timing and feature preferences. The specific signal feature (amplitude, frequency, duration, or rate) was important for the outcome of this interaction effect; signal frequency preferences were very strong and dominated overall signal attractiveness, while signal amplitude, duration or rate preferences were weaker and overall signal attractiveness was largely determined by signal timing preferences. I suggest that preference interactions can result in changes in the dynamics of sexual selection and in the maintenance of variation in signal traits, because males with unattractive signals could gain higher mating success by producing these signals in a leading position, thus weakening or even disrupting feature-based signal selection. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","density dependence; female choice; green treefrog; Hyla cinerea; leader preference; sexual selection; signal amplitude; signal frequency; signal rate; signal timing",,,,,,,,"Höbel, G.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, U.S.A.email: hoebel@uwm.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.026,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Fish seeking to be cleaned (clients) face two potential problems: cleaners may cheat them by feeding on tissue or mucous, and they may have to wait for service from a cleaner. Previous work on interactions between the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, and its clients indicates that cleaners provide higher-quality service to species that have the option of switching partners. These results have been interpreted as evidence that partner choice leads cleaners to behave cooperatively; however, alternative explanations exist for these between-species patterns. Here I focus on interactions between the bluestreak cleaner wrasse and a single client species that varies in its ability to switch partners to test the prediction that clients receive higher-quality service when cleaners have to compete for access to them. The results indicate that cleaners give ornate butterflyfish, Chaetodon ornatissimus, priority of access to their services when these clients can switch partners; however, ornate butterflyfish are not cheated less often when they have access to multiple cleaner stations, and they frequently respond to cheating by aggressively chasing cleaners. In combination with previous work, these results indicate that partner choice influences cooperative interactions between bluestreak cleaner wrasse and their clients, but that some clients with the ability to switch partners may use other strategies (i.e. punishment) to limit cheating by cleaners. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","biological market; bluestreak cleaner wrasse; Chaetodon ornatissimus; cleaning mutualism; conflict; cooperation; Labroides dimidiatus; ornate butterflyfish; partner choice",,,,,,,,"Adam, T.C.; Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.Aemail: adam@lifesci.ucsb.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.023,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Reduced aggression towards territorial neighbours ('dear enemy phenomenon') is based on the assumption that strangers lacking territories pose a greater threat than territory-holding neighbours. Based on the ability of the subterranean rodent Ctenomys talarum (tuco-tuco) to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecific odours, I assessed whether males, the more aggressive sex, show dear enemy relationships and whether social experience with odour donors affects the memory of conspecific odours. Male-male contests in the laboratory were used to compare the aggressive behaviour of pairs of males. Familiar male tuco-tucos responded less aggressively during contests than unfamiliar males, providing evidence of the dear enemy relationship in C. talarum. Memory for familiar odours was affected by social experience since discrimination of known from novel odours lasted longer when males encountered each other in dyadic contests following familiarization with odours. Familiarity by odour cues would represent an important mechanism mediating neighbour recognition and territorial behaviour for tuco-tucos in the wild; intruders may represent a threat of great consequence for territory-holding individuals since they represent the potential loss of their burrow system and their priority of access to neighbouring females. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; Ctenomys talarum; dear enemy relationship; familiarity; memory; odour cues; Tala's tuco-tuco; territoriality",,,,,,,,"Zenuto, R.R.; Laboratorio de Ecofisiología, Departamento de Biología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas yemail: rzenuto@mdp.edu.ar",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.024,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

For example, discriminating among signallers allows receivers to ignore unreliable individuals or to focus their territorial defence on unfamiliar intruders. Such discrimination requires signals to be individually distinctive; that is, signals must vary more among than within individuals. Furthermore, receivers must be able to discriminate among the signals of different individuals. In this study, we used fine structural analysis to show that the simple songs of male black-capped chickadees are individually distinctive, but that substantial variation exists both within and among recordings of the same individual. This finding emphasizes the need for multiple recordings of each individual in studies of individual distinctiveness, since failing to measure variation across recordings of the same individual can make it difficult to determine whether signals vary among individuals or whether they simply vary among different recording sessions. To test whether chickadees discriminate among the signals of different individuals, we used a playback experiment in which we broadcast priming and discrimination stimuli to 45 territorial males. When individuals heard the playback of two different males, they produced more songs and remained near the loudspeaker for a longer period than when they heard two different exemplars from the same male. Chickadees can therefore discriminate among singers based exclusively on their songs, which may help to explain how chickadees eavesdrop on singing contests and subsequently select extrapair mates on the basis of song contest performance. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","black-capped chickadee; communication network; discrimination; eavesdropping; habituation; individual discrimination; individual recognition; individually distinctive signal",,,,,,,,"Wilson, D.R.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Windsor, Canadaemail: drwilson76@gmail.com",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.028,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Despite previous research, questions regarding the response to inequity remain. In this study, we replicated the methodology from previous studies to address four questions related to inequity. First, we explored the impact of basic social factors. Second, we addressed whether negative responses to inequity require a task, or exist when rewards are given for 'free'. Third, we addressed whether differences in the experimental procedure or the level of effort required to obtain a reward affected responses. Finally, we explored the interaction between 'individual' expectations (based on one's own previous experience) and 'social' expectations (based on the partner's experience). These questions were investigated in 16 socially housed adult chimpanzees using eight conditions that varied across the dimensions of reward, effort and procedure. Subjects did respond to inequity, but only in the context of a task. Differences in procedure and level of effort required did not cause individuals to change their behaviour. Males were more sensitive to social than to individual expectation, while females were more sensitive to individual expectation. Finally, subjects also increased refusals when they received a better reward than their partner, which has not been documented previously. These results indicate that chimpanzees are more sensitive to reward inequity than procedures, and that there is interaction between social and individual expectations that depends upon social factors. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chimpanzee; expectation; inequity; Pan troglodytes; prosocial behaviour; sex difference",,,,,,,,"Brosnan, S.F.; Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.email: sbrosnan@gsu.edu",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.019,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Here, we manipulated two components of male giant panda bleats, the formant frequencies (an acoustic cue to size) and the fundamental frequency, to examine male and female responses to bleats characterized by different combinations of these acoustic components. Our results revealed that male giant pandas had greater looking responses and tended to respond faster to bleats with higher formants simulating small adult males. In contrast, females had greater looking responses to bleats with lower formants simulating large adult males. In addition, there was no interaction between the value of the fundamental frequency and the observed response of male and female giant pandas to formant frequency variation in male bleats. Taken together these findings indicate that formants are functionally relevant to male and female giant pandas, and suggest that the level of the fundamental frequency in male bleats does not significantly affect how receivers perceive formant frequency variation. Furthermore, the sex differences in response direction are consistent with the notion that giant pandas could be using formants as cues to the caller's sex, through the correlation with body size, during the breeding season. © 2010.","acoustic cue; formant frequency; fundamental frequency; giant panda; vocal communication",,,,,,,,"Charlton, B.D.; Zoo Atlanta, U.S.A.email: bcharlton@zooatlanta.org",,,,,,,,00033472,,ANBEA,10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.02.018,,"English","Animal Behaviour",Article in Press,Scopus

Web abandonment by orb spiders is a complex decision that is experimentally tractable. For females of the golden orb spider, Nephila clavipes, the web is a microhabitat that serves as a prey capture device, a mating site and a habitat for parasites. Thus, the web embodies the complexity of a bird territory or mammal home range, but is spatially compact and amenable to experimental manipulation. We used both field census data and field experimental manipulations to address the importance of prey capture rate, kleptoparasite load and male presence for web tenure (the time spent at a web site) in both mature and immature female N. clavipes. No factor explained variation in web tenure for immature females, although census data suggested that increased kleptoparasite load decreased web tenure. For mature females, increased male presence decreased web tenure, while increased prey capture rate, condition and body size all increased web tenure. Web tenure also decreased over the course of the season. Females integrate multiple cues to make web movement decisions.

Here, we review studies of habitat choices by multiple, sympatric prey species at risk from a shared predator to show that the defensive decision to avoid or select predator-rich space is contingent on prey escape behaviour. We suggest that prey species with escape tactics offering little chance of survival following an encounter should seek predator scarcity, whereas those with tactics whose post-encounter effectiveness is spatially correlated with predator abundance should be most likely to match the distribution of their predators. Furthermore, we argue that the nature of the defensive spatial response of a prey species with a particular escape tactic also depends on the hunting approach used by its predator and the setting of the predator-prey interaction (i.e. landscape features). Accordingly, an integrated approach that accounts for prey escape behaviour and the context provided by predator hunting mode and landscape features should lead to a better understanding of antipredator spatial shifts and improve our ability to anticipate the consequences of changes in predator numbers for prey distributions and ecosystem dynamics. We conclude by encouraging further exploration of contingency in antipredator behaviour and the possibility that generalist predators might indirectly influence prey resources and community properties via diverse pathways that are mediated by spatial shifts of prey species with different escape tactics. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","antipredator behaviour; context dependence; escape tactic; habitat choice; landscape features; predation risk; predator avoidance; predator hunting mode; predator-prey interaction","abundance; antipredator defense; escape behavior; habitat selection; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; spatial analysis; survival",,,,,,"Botham, M.S., Hayward, R.K., Morrell, L.J., Croft, D.P., Ward, J.R., Ramnarine, I., Krause, J., Risk-sensitive antipredator behavior in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulate (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 3174-3185; Bowers, M.A., Dooley Jr., J.L., Predation hazard and seed removal by small mammals: microhabitat versus patch scale effects (1993) Oecologia, 94, pp. 247-254; Brown, J.S., Kotler, B.P., Hazardous duty pay and the foraging cost of predation (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 999-1014; Christensen, B., Persson, L., Species-specific anti-predator behaviours: effects on prey choice in different habitats (2005) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 32, pp. 1-9; Cooper, W.E., Whiting, M.J., Universal optimization of flight initiation distance and habitat-driven variation in escape tactics in a Namibian lizard assemblage (2007) Ethology, 113, pp. 661-672; Creel, S., Christianson, D., Relationships between direct predation and risk effects (2008) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 23, pp. 194-201; Dill, L.M., Heithaus, M.R., Walters, C.J., Behaviorally mediated indirect interactions in marine communities and their conservation implications (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 1151-1157; Eklöv, P., Persson, L., The response of prey to the risk of predation: proximate cues for refuging juvenile fish (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 105-115; Geist, V., Adaptive behavioural strategies (1982) Elk of North America: Ecology and Management, pp. 219-278. , Thomas J.W., and Toweill D.E.

Females often live within male territories or in female-only areas that are segregated from males. Under these circumstances, females do not have to compete directly with males for space, and in the context of territory acquisition and defence there is therefore no cost to being weaponless. In fiddler crabs, however, weaponless females hold territories among well-armed males. How do they do this? Observations and replacement experiments were carried out on Uca annulipes to determine how males and females acquire and defend territories. Weaponless females were as capable as well-armed males of both acquiring and defending a burrow. Females acquired burrows by seeking out empty ones, while males acquired them by evicting male and female burrow owners. After acquiring a burrow, males mainly fought with male neighbours and females with female neighbours. Both sexes were equally likely to be evicted from their burrow and the likelihood that they remained on their territory for 24 h or more was the same. Males and females thus used different strategies of burrow acquisition and defence, and the male strategy appeared to be more costly. We discuss possible explanations for these differences. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","fiddler crab; sexual dimorphism; territoriality; territory defence; Uca annulipes","burrow; crab; female; sexual dimorphism; site selection; territoriality; Decapoda (Crustacea); Ocypodidae; Uca annulipes",,,,,,"Allen, B.J., Levinton, J.S., Costs of bearing a sexually selected ornamental weapon in a fiddler crab (2007) Functional Ecology, 21, pp. 154-161; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Backwell, P.R.Y., Jennions, M.D., Coalitions among male fiddler crabs (2004) Nature, 430, p. 417; Backwell, P.R.Y., Passmore, N.I., Time constraints and multiple choice criteria in the sampling behaviour and mate choice of the fiddler crab Uca annulipes (1996) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 38, pp. 407-416; (2009) The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-analysis, , Cooper H., Hedges L.V., and Valentine J.C.

In this study, we analysed and compared three such indices, viz Clutton-Brock et al.'s index (CBI), originally developed for red deer, Cervus elaphus, David's score (DS) originally proposed by the statistician H. A. David and the frequency-based index of dominance (FDI) developed and routinely used by our group for the primitively eusocial wasps Ropalidia marginata and Ropalidia cyathiformis. Dominance ranks attributed by all three indices were strongly and positively correlated for both natural data sets from the wasp colonies and for artificial data sets generated for the purpose. However, the indices differed in their ability to yield unique (untied) ranks in the natural data sets. This appears to be caused by the presence of noninteracting individuals and reversals in the direction of dominance in some of the pairs in the natural data sets. This was confirmed by creating additional artificial data sets with noninteracting individuals and with reversals. Based on the criterion of yielding the largest proportion of unique ranks, we found that FDI is best suited for societies such as the wasps belonging to Ropalidia, DS is best suited for societies with reversals and CBI remains a suitable index for societies such as red deer in which multiple interactions are uncommon. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","dominance behaviour; dominance hierarchy; dominance index; dominance rank; Ropalidia cyathiformis; Ropalidia marginata; social wasp","data set; dominance; intraspecific interaction; social insect; wasp; Animalia; Cervus elaphus; Invertebrata; Ropalidia; Ropalidia cyathiformis; Ropalidia marginata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Bayly, K.L., Evans, C.S., Taylor, A., Measuring social structure: a comparison of eight dominance indices (2006) Behavioural Processes, 73, pp. 1-12. , 10.1016/j.beproc.2006.01.011; Berdoy, M., Webster, J.P., Macdonald, D.W., Parasite-altered behaviour: is the effect of Toxoplasma gondii on Rattus norvegicus specific?

Females use natural cavities in roadside banks as nesting sites, which are defended by males against other males. Females leave the nests after oviposition, and all postzygotic parental care is accomplished by males, which protect the eggs and nymphs from predators. We provided artificial mud nests to individuals in the laboratory and conducted observations on the reproduction of the species. Male reproductive success was directly related to nest ownership time: the longer a male held a nest, the higher his chances of obtaining copulations. All males that succeeded in mating and obtaining one clutch eventually mated with additional females that added eggs to the clutch. Thus, desirable males were not limited to monogamy by paternal care. Experimental manipulations demonstrated that guarding males were more attractive to females than were nonguarding males and also that males guarded unrelated eggs. Finally, we found that females and nonguarding males spent more time foraging than guarding males. We use our data to contrast hypotheses on the origin and maintenance of paternal care and to provide a critical assessment of the hypothesis of the evolution of paternal care via sexual selection. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","egg adoption; evolution; female choice; natural selection; Pseudopucrolia; resource defence polygyny; sexual selection; territoriality","arachnid; evolutionary biology; female behavior; hypothesis testing; monogamy; paternal care; polygyny; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; sexual selection; territoriality; Arachnida; Opiliones",,,,,,"Ah-King, M., Kvarnemo, C., Tullberg, B.S., The influence of territoriality and mating system on the evolution of male care: a phylogenetic study on fish (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 371-382; Beck, C.W., Mode of fertilization and parental care in anurans (1998) Animal Behaviour, 55, pp. 439-449; Bhatkar, A., Whitcomb, W.H., Artificial diet for rearing various species of ants (1970) Florida Entomologist, 53, pp. 229-232; Buzatto, B.A., Machado, G., Resource defense polygyny shifts to female defense polygyny over the course of the reproductive season of a Neotropical harvestman (2008) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 63, pp. 85-94; Buzatto, B.A., Machado, G., Amphisexual care in the Neotropical harvestman Acutisoma proximum (Arachnida: Opiliones) (2009) Insectes Sociaux, 56, pp. 106-108; Buzatto, B.A., Requena, G.S., Martins, E.G., Machado, G., Effects of maternal care on the lifetime reproductive success of females in a Neotropical harvestman (2007) Journal of Animal Ecology, 76, pp. 937-945; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Dunlop, J.A., Paleontology (2007) Harvestmen: The Biology of Opiliones, pp. 247-265. , Pinto-da-Rocha R., Machado G., and Giribet G.

In social insects, especially bees, this kind of recognition has mainly been studied with reference to colony-based social interactions, but they also interact in other kinds of group contexts. In the facultatively social carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, individuals of both sexes interact repeatedly, in such activities as cooperative brood raising by females, territorial competition by males, and matings near nest entrances. In light of these varied interactions, in which the ability to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar individuals might be advantageous, the aim of our study was to determine whether X. virginica adults are capable of nestmate recognition. Nestmates were defined operationally as bees that were caught at the same nest entrance after spending the night together, whereas non-nestmates were from different nests. We used circle tube assays of male-male, female-female and male-female dyads to compare rates of aggressive (pushing, biting and C-postures) and tolerant/cooperative (head-to-head touching and passing) behaviour in nestmates versus non-nestmates. In general, aggression occurred sooner and more frequently among non-nestmates than among nestmates, whereas tolerance was more common among nestmates. This indicates that male and female bees can recognize familiar individuals of both sexes and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Since tested individuals may have been nestmates for less than 24 h, this further suggests that both female and male bees may learn the identities of their nestmates quickly. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","carpenter bee; circle tube; facultative sociality; nestmate recognition; Xylocopa virginica","bee; behavioral ecology; fitness; nestmate recognition; Animalia; Apoidea; Hexapoda; Xylocopa virginica; Xylocopinae",,,,,,"Alcock, J., Sleeping aggregations of the bee Idiomelissodes duplocincta (Cockerell) (Hymenoptera: Anthophorini) and their possible function (1998) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 71, pp. 74-84; Arneson, L., Wcislo, W.T., Dominant-subordinate relationships in a facultatively social, nocturnal bee, Megalopta genalis (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) (2003) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 76, pp. 183-193; Barrows, E.M., Male territoriality in the carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica virginica (1983) Animal Behaviour, 31, pp. 806-813; Barthell, J.F., Baird, T.A., Size variation and aggression among male Xylocopa virginica (L.)

We examined both behaviours and their interaction for male cuttlefish, Sepia lycidas, as a strategic investment. Males increased the duration of sperm removal and the number of ejaculations per mating when they were not the last male who had mated with the current partner. These responses would decrease the number of rival sperm and increase the male's own sperm in the fertilization area. Recognition of the female's mating history appeared to result from close mate guarding during successive matings. Moreover, when the last mate of the current partner was different from the current mate, there was a significant negative relationship between sperm removal duration and the number of subsequent ejaculations. This interaction suggests both strategic investment allocation and constraints on each mating investment as possible results of mating interruption by other males and spermatophore depletion, respectively. In addition, larger males with high competitive ability prolonged sperm removal when the last mate of the current partner was different from the current mate, whereas smaller males with relatively larger testes ejaculated more times during a mating. Male S. lycidas might adjust the duration of sperm removal at the risk of failing to achieve ejaculation and allocate their finite ejaculate expenditures based on the results (i.e. the increasing proportion of their own sperm). © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","cephalopod; ejaculatory behaviour; female mating history; kisslip cuttlefish; promiscuity; Sepia lycidas; sperm competition; sperm displacement; sperm removal behaviour","behavioral response; marine ecosystem; mating behavior; mollusc; sperm competition; spermatophore; Cephalopoda; Sepia lycidas; Sepiidae",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Hanlon, R.T., Do cuttlefish signal their intention to conspecifics during agonistic encounters?

For cooperative interactions biological market theory proposes that signalling strength may be linked to supply and demand. In this context, a recent laboratory experiment demonstrated that cleaner shrimps may advertise their service to client reef fish and that the advertisement is linked to hunger levels. We investigated signalling by the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes longicarpus in the field to test more detailed predictions of biological market theory. Shrimps often clapped with their pair of claws in response to approaching clients. In line with both theory and the previous study, the probability of clapping increased when the shrimps had been food deprived and clapping shrimps were more likely to clean than nonclapping individuals. However, we found no evidence for the market theory prediction that signalling was targeted specifically to visiting client species with the option to choose other cleaning stations. Instead, shrimps signalled more frequently towards predatory clients than towards nonpredatory clients.

Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the effect of density on resource defence in groups with large asymmetries in competitive ability, as a consequence of, for example, age and/or body size. We used two age classes (i.e. size groups) of stream-living brown trout, Salmo trutta, to investigate this issue. While old (and large) trout are assumed to be superior during interference competition, younger individuals may be both numerically dominant and constitute more than half of the total population biomass. In this experiment, the ability of one yearling to monopolize a concentrated food source was observed at four densities of under-yearlings (zero, two, six and 12) in an indoor seminatural stream. We predicted that the success of defence would decrease with increasing under-yearling density and that the frequency of defence (i.e. aggression) would peak at an intermediate density. As predicted, yearlings made significantly more unsuccessful foraging attempts and adopted darker body coloration at high density of under-yearlings, suggesting increased stress levels. However, in contrast to our second prediction, the number of aggressive interactions increased progressively with density. These novel findings suggest that the cost of defence increases with under-yearling density, probably as a consequence of stress from interference with under-yearlings employing alternative competitive strategies. However, the difference in size seems to enable yearlings to defend the food resource at higher density of competitors than predicted from the resource defence theory. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; body colour; competition; defence; density; fish; foraging; intercohort; Salmo trutta; trout","age class; aggression; biomass; body size; color morph; foraging behavior; freshwater ecosystem; population density; salmonid; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",,,,,,"Abbott, J.C., Dill, L.M., The relative growth of dominant and subordinate juvenile steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) fed equal rations (1989) Behaviour, 108, pp. 104-113; Adams, C.E., Huntingford, F.A., Turnbull, J.F., Beattie, C., Alternative competitive strategies and the cost of food acquisition in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (1998) Aquaculture, 167, pp. 17-26. , 10.1016/S0044-8486(98)00302-0; Adams, C.E., Huntingford, F.A., Turnbull, J.F., Arnott, S., Bell, A., Size heterogeneity can reduce aggression and promote growth in Atlantic salmon parr (2000) Aquaculture International, 8, pp. 543-549; Alanärä, A., Brännäs, E., Dominance in demand-feeding behaviour in Arctic charr and rainbow trout: the effect of stocking density (1996) Journal of Fish Biology, 48, pp. 242-254; Berglund, A., Mating systems and sex allocation (1997) Behavioural Ecology of Teleost Fishes, pp. 237-265. , Godin J.-G.J.

Here we explored the evolutionary patterns of mechanosensory function of similar facial feather ornaments in related species. In an experimental chamber (maze) devoid of visible light, crested auklets, A. cristatella, a close relative of the whiskered auklet, showed an increase in head bumps (262%) after trial flattening of their forehead crest. The frequency of head bumps in the absence of the crest was positively correlated with the natural crest length of the crested auklet. There was no correlation between crest length and head bumps when we added an artificial crest to least auklets, A. pusilla, which do not have a natural crest. Thus, only the ornamented Aethia species that breed in deep-crevice appear to have detectable mechanosensory ability. A pairwise analysis across all nonpasserine bird families further revealed a greater frequency of elongated facial plumes in birds that live in complex habitats and are active during low light conditions. We suggest that selective pressure enforced by complex habitats may trigger facial feather exaggeration for mechanosensory use. Once the primordial sensory structures evolved, sexual and other social selection processes could act on these traits and lead towards further exaggeration. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aethia; auklet; feather ornament; mechanosensory trait; natural selection; pairwise comparison; sexual selection","evolutionary theory; feather; life history trait; seabird; sexual selection; Aethia; Aethia cristatella; Aethia pusilla; Aethia pygmaea; Aves",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Baker, R.R., Parker, G.A., The evolution of bird coloration (1979) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 287, pp. 63-130; Borgia, G., The cost of display in the non-resource-based mating system of the satin bowerbird (1993) American Naturalist, 141, pp. 729-743; Bowmaker, J.K., Martin, G.R., Visual pigments and oil droplets in the penguin, Spheniscus humboldti (1985) Journal of Comparative Physiology, 156, pp. 71-77; Bowmaker, J.K., Heath, L.A., Wilkie, S.E., Hunt, D.M., Visual pigments and oil droplets from six classes of photoreceptor in the retinas of birds (1997) Vision Research, 37, pp. 2183-2194; Bro-Jørgensen, J., Johnstone, R.A., Evans, M.R., Uninformative exaggeration of male sexual ornaments in barn swallows (2007) Current Biology, 17, pp. 850-855; Brooks, R., Endler, J.A., Female guppies agree to differ: phenotypic and genetic variation in mate-choice behavior and the consequences for sexual selection (2001) Evolution, 55, pp. 1644-1655; Brooke, M.L., Hanley, S., Laughlin, S.B., The scaling of eye size with body mass in birds (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266, pp. 405-412; Byrd, G.V., Williams, J.C., Whiskered auklet (Aethia pygmaea) (1993) The Birds of North America.

Accordingly, reproductive interference can reduce female and male fitness and lead to sexual exclusion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that flexible mating behaviours could mitigate the fitness-reducing effects of reproductive interference between reproductively incompatible biotypes of the haplodiploid whitefly Bemisia tabaci. We show that females of the globally distributed and invasive B biotype respond to reproductive interference from the Q biotype by increasing their acceptance of copulation attempts from B males. This behavioural plasticity increases the ability of B females to mate successfully and maintain a constant sex ratio in their offspring despite reproductive interference. In contrast, females of competing biotypes have invariant behaviour and produce fewer female offspring because of reproductive interference from the B biotype. Heuristic simulation models incorporating data on behavioural and life history traits of the B and Q biotypes obtained here, and published data on other biotypes, show that this plasticity in mating behaviour of B females could contribute to sexual exclusion of closely related biotypes. Our results demonstrate a powerful link between mating behaviour, reproductive interference and sexual exclusion, suggesting that variation in mating behaviour could determine the effects of reproductive interference and drive sexual exclusion among closely related species or among biotypes of a species. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioural plasticity Bemisia tabaci; biotype; fitness; sex ratio; sexual exclusion whitefly","behavioral ecology; biotype; fitness; hypothesis testing; life history trait; mating behavior; reproductive effort; sex ratio; whitefly; Aleyrodidae; Bemisia tabaci",,,,,,"Andersson, M.B., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Brown, J.K., Frohlich, D.R., Rosell, R.C., The sweetpotato or silverleaf whiteflies: biotypes of Bemisia tabaci or a species complex?

We investigated to what extent avoidance learning and long-term memory for plant unsuitability underlie foraging responses in the field. First, the acceptability of 10 rarely harvested plant species was tested on field colonies located in two different habitats, where the tested plant species were either present or not. Colonies in the habitat where the plant species occurred avoided all species on first encounter, suggesting previous experience with them. Colonies without the plant species in their habitat, however, first accepted, but then avoided four of them when tested after 24 and 48 h. Such an avoidance response towards previously acceptable leaves could be experimentally induced by infiltrating acceptable leaves with a fungicide (cycloheximide) not detectable to the ants, but harmful to the symbiotic fungus, indicating that workers learn to reject plants that have detrimental effects on the fungus, but not on themselves. To determine how robust memory for plant unsuitability was, workers from field colonies were offered the previously avoided, yet untreated plant every 2 weeks, and its acceptance monitored in the long term. It took up to 18 weeks until foragers harvested the plant again, indicating the involvement of robust long-term avoidance learning in foragers. We argue that the harvesting pattern observed in field colonies largely depends on the workers' foraging experience, essential in a highly diverse environment where both leaf availability and quality vary throughout the year. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Atta colombica; aversive learning; delayed rejection; experience; foraging; host plant selection; leaf-cutting ant; memory; Panama","ant; foraging behavior; fungicide; fungus; host selection; learning; memory; plant-herbivore interaction; symbiosis; Atta; Atta columbica; Formicidae; Fungi",,,,,,"Bass, M., The effects of leaf deprivation on leaf-cutting ants and their mutualistic fungus (1997) Ecological Entomology, 22, pp. 384-389; Bass, M., Cherrett, J.M., Fungal hyphae as a source of nutrients for the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens (1995) Physiological Entomology, 20, pp. 1-6; Camargo, R.S., Forti, L.C., de Matos, C.A.O., Lopes, J.F., de Andrade, A.P.P., Ramos, V.M., Post-selection and return of foraged material by Acromyrmex subterraneus brunneus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (2003) Sociobiology, 42, pp. 93-102; Cherrett, J.M., Leaf-cutting ants (1989) Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystems: Biogeographical and Ecological Studies, pp. 473-488. , Lieth H., and Werger M.J.A.

Here we demonstrate experimentally that a cognitively advanced, social bird, the American crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos, quickly and accurately learns to recognize the face of a dangerous person and continues to do so for at least 2.7 years. We exposed wild crows to a novel 'dangerous face' by wearing a unique face mask as we trapped, banded and released 7-15 birds at five sites near Seattle, WA, U.S.A. After trapping, crows consistently used harsh vocalizations to scold and mob people of different sizes, ages, genders and walking gaits who wore the dangerous mask, even when they were in crowds. In contrast, prior to trapping, few crows scolded people who wore the dangerous mask. Furthermore, after trapping, few crows scolded trappers who wore no mask or who wore a mask that had not been worn during trapping. In a fully crossed, balanced experiment in which each site had a unique trapping (dangerous) mask and five neutral masks, crows scolded and mobbed a mask more when it was the dangerous mask at that site than when it was a neutral mask at another site. When simultaneously presented with a person in the dangerous mask and a person in the neutral mask, crows typically ignored the neutral mask and followed and scolded the person wearing the dangerous mask. Risky, aggressive scolding by crows was sensitive to variable costs across study sites; aggression was less where people persecuted crows most. We suggest that conditioned and observational learning of specific threats may allow local bird behaviours to include aversions to individual people. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","American crow; Corvus brachyrhynchos; ecologically relevant conditioned response; individual recognition; learning; memory; mobbing; recognition of humans; scolding","aggression; behavioral ecology; learning; mobbing; passerine; vocalization; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]; Animalia; Aves; Corvidae; Corvus brachyrhynchos",,,,,,"Adachi, I., Kuwahata, H., Fujita, K., Dogs recall their owner's face upon hearing the owner's voice (2007) Animal Cognition, 10, pp. 17-21; Adolphs, R., Fear, faces, and the human amygdala (2008) Current Opinion Neurobiology, 18, pp. 166-172; Barnard, C.J., Burk, T., Dominance hierarchies and the evolution of individual recognition (1979) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 81, pp. 65-73; Bednekoff, P.A., Balda, R.P., Kamil, A.C., Hile, A.G., Long-term spatial memory in four seed-caching corvid species (1997) Animal Behaviour, 53, pp. 335-341; Biro, P.A., Dingemanse, N.J., Sampling bias resulting from animal personality (2008) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 66-67; Brooks, R.J., Falls, J.B., Individual recognition by song in white-throated sparrows. 1.

The death adder, Acanthophis antarcticus, attracts prey by wriggling the distal portion of its tail (caudal luring). To understand the design of this deceptive signal, we explored perceptual processes in a representative prey species: the Jacky dragon, Amphibolurus muricatus. We used 3D animations of fast and slow death adder luring movements against different backgrounds, to test the hypothesis that caudal luring mimics salient aspects of invertebrate prey. Moving stimuli elicited predatory responses, especially against a conspicuous background. To identify putative models for caudal luring, we used an optic flow algorithm to extract velocity values from video sequences of 61 moving invertebrates caught in lizard territories, and compared these to the velocity values of death adder movements. Caudal lures had motion characteristics that matched common invertebrate prey speeds, each corresponding to a peak in a bimodal distribution. Subsequent video playback tests using animations of crickets showed that significantly more attacks were evoked by stimuli moving at common than at rare invertebrate speeds. Overall, these results suggest that biases in the nervous system of the receiver, originally selected for prey recognition, might have been exploited by the design of the caudal luring signal. We suggest that viewing caudal luring from this perspective, rather than thinking of it as aggressive mimicry per se, may help us understand the function and evolutionary origin of this behaviour. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggressive mimicry; Amphibolurus muricatus; death adder; deceptive signal; Jacky dragon; movement-based signal; receiver psychology; sensory bias; signal design","lizard; mimicry; psychology; signal; Acanthophis antarcticus; Amphibolurus muricatus; Gryllidae; Invertebrata; Squamata",,,,,,"Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 57, pp. 289-300. , 10.2307/2346101; Blumstein, D.T., Evans, C.S., Daniel, J.C., (2000) JWatcher 1.0, , http://galliform.bhs.mq.edu.au/jwatcher; Carlile, P.A., Peters, R.A., Evans, C.S., Detection of a looming stimulus by the Jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus): selective sensitivity to characteristics of an aerial predator (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 553-562. , 10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.10.027; Carpenter, C.C., Murphy, J.B., Carpenter, G.C., Tail luring in the death adder, Acanthophis antarcticus (Reptilia, Serpentes, Elapidae) (1978) Journal of Herpetology, 12, pp. 574-577; Chiszar, D., Boyer, D., Lee, R., Murphy, J.B., Radcliffe, C.W., Caudal luring in the southern death adder, Acanthophis antarcticus (1990) Journal of Herpetology, 24, pp. 253-260; Cleves, M.A., Gould, W.W., Gutierrez, R.G., (2002) An Introduction to Survival Analysis using Stata, , Stata Press, College Station, Texas; Cogger, H.G., (2000) Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, , Reed New Holland, Sydney; Dawkins, R., Krebs, J.R., Animal signals: information or manipulation (1978) Behavioural Ecology: an Evolutionary Approach, pp. 282-309. , Krebs J.R., and Davies N.B.

We studied the effect of the presence of conspecific larvae and their tracks on the oviposition site selection of an aphid-specific predator, Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera: Syrphidae), in two-choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the volatile chemicals released from odour extracts of E. balteatus larval tracks. The behavioural effects of these volatile substances on hoverfly females were also evaluated. Our experiments demonstrated that E. balteatus females were deterred from ovipositing when presented with a Vicia faba leaf with aphids and conspecific larvae. The oviposition-deterring stimulus was also active when females were presented with a leaf that contained conspecific larval tracks. A mixture of chemical compounds was found in the volatile pattern of odour extracts of larval tracks. The main volatile chemicals were 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hexanoic acid and phenol. Females also laid significantly fewer eggs in response to odorant volatiles emitted from larval extracts. These results highlight that predatory hoverfly females avoid ovipositing in aphid colonies in which conspecific larvae or their tracks are already present, suggesting that this behaviour constitutes a strategy that enables females to optimize their oviposition site and reduce competition suffered by their offspring. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aphid; conspecific larva; Episyrphus balteatus; hoverfly; larval track; Myzus persicae; oviposition site selection; oviposition-deterring substance; syrphid behaviour; Vicia faba","aphid; behavioral ecology; conspecific; gas chromatography; larva; mass spectrometry; oviposition; site selection; volatile substance; Aphididae; Diptera; Episyrphus balteatus; Myzus persicae; Syrphidae; Vicia faba",,,,,,"Agarwala, B.K., Bardhanory, P., Yasuda, H., Takizawa, T., Effects of conspecific and heterospecific competitors on feeding and oviposition of a predatory ladybird: a laboratory study (2003) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 106, pp. 219-226; Almohamad, R., Verheggen, F.J., Francis, F., Haubruge, E., Evaluation of hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera: Syrphidae) oviposition behaviour toward aphid- infested plants using a leaf disc system (2006) Communications in Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences, Ghent University, 71, pp. 403-412; Almohamad, R., Verheggen, F.J., Francis, F., Haubruge, E., Predatory hoverflies select their oviposition site according to aphid host plant and aphid species (2007) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 125, pp. 13-21; Almohamad, R., Verheggen, F.J., Francis, F., Haubruge, E., Discrimination of parasitized aphids by a hoverfly predator: effect on larval performance, foraging and oviposition behavior (2008) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 128, pp. 73-80; Almohamad, R., Verheggen, F.J., Francis, F., Lognay, G., Haubruge, E., Emission of alarm pheromone by non-preyed aphid colonies (2008) Journal of Applied Entomology, 132, pp. 601-604; Almohamad, R., Verheggen, F.J., Haubruge, E., Searching and oviposition behavior of aphidophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae): a review (2009) Biotechnologie, Agronomie, Société et Environnement, 13, pp. 467-481; Anbutsu, H., Togashi, K., Deterred oviposition of Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) on Pinus densiflora bolts from oviposition scars containing eggs or larvae (1996) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 31, pp. 481-488; Anbutsu, H., Togashi, K., Oviposition behavior and response to the oviposition scars occupied by eggs in Monochamus saltuarius (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) (1997) Applied Entomology and Zoology, 32, pp. 541-549; Anderson, P., Hilker, M., Hansson, B.S., Bombosch, S., Klein, B., Schildknecht, H., Oviposition deterring components in larval frass of Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.)

We combined behavioural data on individual vigilance of herbivores at waterholes with fine-scale spatiotemporal data from 27 African lions, Panthera leo, fitted with GPS radiocollars to test whether individual prey vigilance increases when predators are in the vicinity and whether this relationship is influenced by group size and presence of other herbivores. The study was conducted on giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, greater kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros, and plains zebra, Equus quagga, in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, between mid-September and mid-November 2008. Kudu was the only species to adjust its vigilance level significantly in the presence of lions, arguably owing to its higher contribution to lion diet in Hwange. Kudu devoted a significantly higher proportion of time to vigilance when lions were in the vicinity. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent on individual vigilance decreased as group size increased during the approach and drinking phases, particularly when lions were in the vicinity. Finally, the presence of other herbivores at the waterhole enabled kudu to spend less time vigilant while drinking. These adjustments involved changes in the length of vigilance bouts, but not in their frequency. Our study suggests that the interplay between the context (group size, presence of other prey) and the immediate presence of predators determines the level of vigilance in prey. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","African lion; African savannah; antipredator behaviour; giraffe; Hwange National Park; kudu; waterhole; zebra","diet; drinking; group size; herbivore; national park; predation risk; ruminant; spatiotemporal analysis; vigilance; Hwange National Park; Matabeleland North; Zimbabwe; Equus burchellii; Equus quagga; Equus subg.

Being paired with a better-than-average mate is one such favourable circumstance. High-quality fathers can improve conditions for their offspring by providing good genes, good resources, or both, so females paired to such males should invest preferentially in sons. Ornamentation has been linked to male quality in many birds, and, in support of differential allocation theory, females of several avian species invest more in entire broods when paired to attractive mates. Additionally, the females of some bird species apparently manipulate the primary sex ratio of their broods in relation to the attractiveness of their mates. However, empirical support for a link between mate ornamentation and preferential feeding of sons (another form of biased investment) is lacking. We tested for correlations between sex-biased parental investment and mate plumage colour in the eastern bluebird, Sialia sialis, a species in which juveniles have sexually dichromatic UV blue plumage. We found that the proportion of maternal feeding attempts to fledgling sons (versus fledgling daughters) was positively correlated with structurally coloured plumage ornamentation of fathers. Additionally, paternal feeding attempts to sons were correlated with plumage ornamentation of mothers and increased in fathers that had breast plumage characteristics typical of older males. These results provide further support for the idea that parental strategies are influenced by mate attractiveness and provide the first evidence that mate ornamentation can influence parental behaviour even after offspring have left the nest. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","colour; eastern bluebird; honest signal; ornament; parental behaviour; plumage; resource allocation; sex ratio; Sialia sialis","gene; ornamentation; parental care; passerine; plumage; reproductive success; resource allocation; sex ratio; Aves; Sialia sialis",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Blank, J.L., Nolan, V., Offspring sex-ratio in red-winged blackbirds is dependent on maternal age (1983) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., 80, pp. 6141-6145; Bradbury, R.R., Blakey, J.K., Diet, maternal condition, and offspring sex ratio in the zebra finch, Poephila guttata (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 265, pp. 895-899; Burley, N., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Bustamante, J., Predictive models for lesser kestrel Falco naumanni distribution, abundance, and extinction in southern Spain (1997) Biological Conservation, 80, pp. 153-160; Charnov, E.L., (1982) The Theory of Sex Allocation, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Reproductive success (1988) Reproductive Success, pp. 472-485. , Clutton-Brock T.H.

However, comparative studies on diverse populations of domestic dog are lacking, making species-wide generalizations premature. In this study we present the performance of one under-represented population, stray dogs living in shelters, on a human-guided object-choice task. Unlike pet dogs, shelter dogs universally failed to follow a momentary distal point to a target location in initial tests, although they were able to follow a simpler form of human point on the same task. Furthermore, the majority of subjects learned to follow a momentary distal point to a target when given additional training trials (experiment 2). Dogs' sensitivity to human gestures may not be entirely explained by phylogenetic variables; rather, the interactions between genetic, developmental and experiential variables must be considered. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Canis familiaris; domestic dog; human pointing gesture; learning; object-choice task; shelter dog; social cognition; stray dog; Two Stage hypothesis","canid; cognition; learning; shelter; social behavior; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"American Veterinary Medicine Association, (2007) U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook, , American Veterinary Medicine Association, Schaumburg, Illinois; Bentosela, M., Barrera, G., Jakovcevic, A., Elgier, A., Mustaca, A., Effect of reinforcement, reinforcer omission and extinction on a communicative response in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) (2008) Behavioral Processes, 78, pp. 464-469; Dorey, N.R., Udell, M.A.R., Wynne, C.D.L., Breed differences in dogs' sensitivity to human points: a meta-analysis (2009) Behavioural Processes, 81, pp. 400-415; Dorey, N., Udell, M.A.R., Wynne, C.D.L., When do domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, start to understand human pointing?

Sight is also assumed to play a role in schooling, as fish with a cut lateral line do not stop schooling unless they are also blinded. This conclusion, however, is based on experiments where only the trunk lateral line was inactivated, leaving the head lateral system intact. We investigated how inactivation of the whole lateral system affects fish shoaling behaviour. Groups of firehead tetras, Hemigrammus bleheri, were videorecorded before and after inactivation of their whole lateral system with aminoglycoside antibiotics (and also in sham-treated specimens). Shoaling behaviour was characterized by nearest distance to the first, second and third neighbours, shoal radius, shoal order parameter and the number of collisions between individuals. Scanning electron microscope observations showed damage to most superficial neuromasts as a result of antibiotic treatment. Importantly, the antibiotic-treated fish proved unable to maintain a shoal. After the end of the treatment, however, they recovered both a normal tissue morphology and normal shoaling behaviour within about a month. The lateral system is thus more crucial to shoaling behaviour than previously believed. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","firehead tetra; fish; hair cell bundle; Hemigrammus bleheri; lateral system; neuromast; shoaling behaviour","antibiotics; freshwater ecosystem; scanning electron microscopy; schooling behavior; teleost; videography; Hemigrammus bleheri; Teleostei; Tetra",,,,,,"Becco, C., Vandewalle, N., Delcourt, J., Poncin, P., Experimental evidences of a structural and dynamical transition in fish school (2006) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 367, pp. 487-493; Blaxter, J.H.S., Batty, R.S., Herring behaviour in the dark: responses to stationary and continuously vibrating obstacles (1985) Journal of the Marine Biological Association U.K., 65, pp. 1031-1049; Blaxter, J.H.S., Fuiman, L.A., Function of the free neuromasts of marine teleost larvae (1989) The Mechanosensory Lateral Line, pp. 481-499. , Coombs S., Görner P., and Münz H.

We tested whether the presence of adults during early development influences the social behaviour of juveniles later on in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. In a split-brood design we raised half of the broods together with parents and with or without brood care helpers, and the other half without adults. During early rearing, fry raised with adults showed more aggressive and submissive behaviour to each other than fish raised with siblings only. After transferring the young to a neutral environment lacking adult conspecifics we tested their social performance in a competitive situation. Either young were assigned the ownership of a shelter or they had no shelter of their own. As shelter owners, fish that had been raised with adults showed more of an energetically cheaper, restrained form of aggression, while as intruders they behaved submissively more often than fish raised without adults. The strength of these treatment effects depended on the opponent's social experience, and contests were terminated earlier only when both opponents had been raised with adults. Our results show that the social-rearing conditions persistently affect the economy and adequacy of individual reactions to social challenges, which is reminiscent of social competence effects known from humans. Remarkably, during the social treatment period brood care involved only protection but no direct interactions between adults and young. We discuss potential mechanisms by which the presence of brood-caring adults may persistently affect social skills in animals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggressive behaviour; cichlid; cooperative breeder; early environment; Neolamprologus pulcher; ontogeny; social skill; submissive behaviour","aggression; brood rearing; cooperative behavior; freshwater ecosystem; juvenile; ontogeny; perciform; Animalia; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher",,,,,,"Adkins-Regan, E., Krakauer, A., Removal of adult males from the rearing environment increases preference for same-sex partners in the zebra finch (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 47-53; Amorim, M.C.P., Knight, M.E., Stratoudakis, Y., Turner, G.F., Differences in sounds made by courting males of three closely related Lake Malawi cichlid species (2004) Journal of Fish Biology, 65, pp. 1358-1371; Balshine-Earn, S., Neat, F.C., Reid, H., Taborsky, M., Paying to stay or paying to breed?

Social bonds between familiar conspecifics may also be formed, especially in chicks from precocial species in which behaviour is characterized by a strong social attraction. We investigated the establishment of such a bond and the effect of social motivation using a separation/reunion test in 1-week-old Japanese quail. In experiment 1, the behaviour of paired quail selected for high (HSR) or low (LSR) social reinstatement behaviour was recorded during three successive 10 min situations: baseline, separation and return of the cagemate. Both lines showed behavioural changes during social separation but the distress response was higher in the HSR line. Return of the familiar cagemate induced a return to baseline activity in both lines. The specificity of this response was tested in experiment 2 in which paired quail of both lines were separated, and their behavioural and vocal responses to the introduction of the familiar or an unfamiliar bird were compared. LSR chicks responded differently both behaviourally and vocally according to the familiarity of the introduced bird, whereas the response of HSR chicks differed only for aggressive pecks. HSR quail chicks thus revealed a nonspecific social attraction for conspecifics, whereas LSR chicks showed a bond with the cagemate. Our results highlight the importance of vocal communication as an indicator of the strength of the bond. Our findings show that high social motivation in quail chicks is not related to the development of a social bond. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","affinity; bird; chick; Coturnix japonica; genetic selection; Japanese quail; separation/reunion test; social relationship; vocalization","bird; separation; sibling; social network; vocalization; Aves; Coturnix; Coturnix japonica; Phasianidae",,,,,,"Bardet, J., Essen, D.K., Féron, C., Gouat, P., Evaluation of the social bond: a new method tested in Mus spicilegus (2007) Comptes Rendus Biologies, 330, pp. 837-843; Barrows, E.M., Individually distinctive odors in an invertebrates (1975) Behavioral Biology, 15, pp. 57-64; Bertin, A., Richard-Yris, M.A., Mothering during early development influences subsequent emotional and social behaviour in Japanese quail (2005) Journal of Experimental Zoology, 303 A, pp. 792-801; Boissy, A., Le Neindre, P., Behavioral, cardiac and cortisol responses to brief peer separation and reunion in cattle (1997) Physiology & Behavior, 61, pp. 693-699; Boivin, X., Tournadre, H., Le Neindre, P., Hand-feeding and gentling influence early-weaned lambs' attachment responses to their stockperson (2000) Journal of Animal Science, 78, pp. 879-884; Bolhuis, J., Mechanism of avian imprinting: a review (1991) Biological Reviews, 66, pp. 303-345; Bradshaw, R.H., Discrimination of group members by laying hens Gallus domesticus (1991) Behavioural Processes, 24, pp. 143-151; Broad, K.D., Curley, J.P., Keverne, E.B., Mother-infant bonding and the evolution of mammalian social relationships (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 361, pp. 2199-2214; Cailotto, M., Vallortigara, G., Zanforlin, M., Sex difference in the response to social stimuli in young chick (1989) Ethology, Ecology & Evolution, 1, pp. 323-327; Carmichael, N.L., Jones, B.R., Mills, A.D., Social preferences in Japanese quail chicks from lines selected for low or high social reinstatement motivation: effects of number and line identity of the stimulus birds (1998) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 58, pp. 353-363; Cézilly, F., Préault, M., Dubois, F., Faivre, B., Patris, B., Pair-bonding in birds and the active role of females: a critical review of the empirical evidence (2000) Behavioural Processes, 51, pp. 83-92; Charrier, I., Mathevon, N., Jouventin, P., Aubin, T., Acoustic communication in a black-headed gull colony: how do chicks identify their parents?

Because male bowerbirds steal each other's decorations, decoration theft could lead to an honest relationship between male quality and signal size. To test this hypothesis, I conducted an experiment in which I standardized decoration numbers at bowers of the great bowerbird, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, such that all males had equal numbers. I then monitored males for 11 weeks as they stole decorations from other males, defended their decorations against theft, and collected decorations from the environment. For two commonly stolen decoration types (red wire and green plastic), there was a correlation between the numbers at bowers before and after standardization. Males that had more red wires and green plastic pieces before standardization were less likely to have these decorations stolen from their bowers after standardization, although they were not more successful at stealing decorations. These males also collected more red wires and green plastic pieces from the environment, and collecting rate was unrelated to the numbers available near the bower. Males that were more successful at guarding their decorations had longer nuchal crests and had been bower owners for longer periods, although nearest-neighbour distance explained more of the variation in guarding ability than either male characteristic. These results suggest decoration numbers are an honest signal of the male's ability to guard his bower against theft and to locate decorations in the environment, although some variation in stealing behaviours may be related to the spatial arrangement of males rather than to male quality. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal construction;

Keck Center for Behavioral Biology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, United States","The ability to distinguish between members of a social group and unfamiliar individuals is a critical element of social behaviour. Social insects can differentiate between nestmates and non-nestmates via recognition cues, which in most species are cuticular hydrocarbons. Cuticular hydrocarbon patterns are altered by genotype and environmental conditions, but it is unclear whether colony social conditions can also affect nestmate interactions. Honeybee queens produce pheromones that regulate many aspects of worker behaviour, physiology and colony organization. A five-component blend, queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), produces many of the effects of a live queen. We found that QMP treatment alters how resident bees interact with intruder bees, based on standard nestmate recognition assays. However, QMP does not appear to alter the ability of bees to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates, or general aggression levels. Rather, QMP exposure significantly alters cuticular hydrocarbon patterns of worker bees, suggesting that QMP-treated nestmates are no longer recognized as nestmates by untreated bees, and vice versa. Thus, queen pheromone can have significant effects on nestmate recognition and interactions in honeybees, which may be important for colony cohesion. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression;

Prior empirical work has focused on (1) assortative mating based on major histocompatibility complex alleles and (2) trade-offs between reproductive effort and immunocompetence that signal mate quality. These two approaches to understanding the link between immunity and mate choice have remained separate. Given that the immune system must flexibly respond to pathogens that an individual encounters over the course of a lifetime, it is important that researchers begin to incorporate both genetic and phenotypic indexes of immunity in studies of mate choice. Here, I outline several ways that investigators can begin to use a combination of immunogenetic and immunocompetence data to answer open questions about the influence of immunity on mate choice. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioural plasticity; birds; immunity; immunocompetence; major histocompatibility complex; mate choice","allele; bird; fitness; immune system; immunity; immunocompetence; life history trait; mate choice; mating behavior; trade-off; Aves",,,,,,"Acevedo-Whitehouse, K., Cunningham, A.A., Is MHC enough for understanding wildlife immunogenetics?

Although altruism is expected theoretically to be kin biased and frequent in a reciprocal context, few experimental studies to date have specifically tested these hypotheses from the viewpoint of proximate mechanisms. We examined the other-regarding preferences of individuals in mother-offspring pairs and in nonkin adult pairs in both reciprocal and nonreciprocal contexts. Based on the previously established choice paradigm with mutually or selfishly beneficial options, we developed a novel task using buttons. In experiment 1, chimpanzee participants involving three mother-offspring pairs were offered two options: delivering food rewards to their partner and themselves or only to themselves. We compared their choices between partner-present and partner-absent conditions. In experiment 2, we developed a reciprocal context in which the two participants alternately chose the two options. In contrast to the theoretical predictions, the chimpanzees did not show any prosocial tendencies even between mother and offspring or in a reciprocal context. We propose that the experimental set-up which prevented direct interactions between the participants might have influenced these results. In conclusion, the present study suggests that voluntary and/or strategic other-rewarding behaviour arose in humans after divergence from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","altruism; chimpanzee; mother-offspring relationship; nepotism; other-regarding preference; Pan troglodytes; prosociality; proximate mechanism; reciprocity","altruism; evolutionary biology; human evolution; hypothesis testing; kinship; maternal effect; nepotism; primate; reciprocity; Pan; Pan troglodytes",,,,,,"Boysen, S.T., Berntson, G.G., Responses to quantity: perceptual versus cognitive mechanisms in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (1995) Journal of Experimental Psychology, 21, pp. 82-86; Boysen, S.T., Berntson, G.G., Hannan, M.B., Cacioppo, J.T., Quantity-based interference and symbolic representations in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (1996) Journal of Experimental Psychology, 22, pp. 76-86; Boysen, S.T., Mukobi, K.L., Berntson, G.G., Overcoming response bias using symbolic representations of number by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (1999) Animal Learning and Behavior, 27, pp. 229-235; Bräuer, J., Call, J., Tomasello, M., Are apes really inequity averse?

Here we show that information on dominance status in male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a small, temperate, North American songbird, can be extracted from individual songs. We found that the relative amplitude of the two notes in the 'fee bee' song of this species was more consistent in dominant males. Furthermore, females responded differently to presentations of single song exemplars from males of different dominance status, with females vocalizing more and performing more motor behaviours during the presentation of dominant songs. Our study suggests that non-pitch-based cues within single vocalizations can both reliably indicate relative rank and be discriminated by females. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","advertisement; black-capped chickadee; communication; dominance; Poecile atricapillus","auditory cue; communication; dominance; female behavior; songbird; vocalization; Apoidea; Parus atricapillus; Passeri",,,,,,"Amy, M., Monbureau, M., Durand, C., Gomez, D., Thery, M., Leboucher, G., Female canary mate preferences: differential use of information from two types of male-male interaction (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 971-982; Ballentine, B., Hyman, J., Nowicki, S., Vocal performance influences female response to male bird song: an experimental test (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 163-168; Bloomfield, L.L., Sturdy, C.B., All 'chick-a-dee' calls are not created equally.

In the laboratory, females of the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus prefer large males that court (courters) to small males that sneak (sneakers). However, variation in this preference is related to female size, with the strength of preference for courter males increasing with female size. In this study we found that both a female's size and her strength of preference for courter males were significantly related to whether or not she mated with a courter male. These results provide strong evidence for variation in female mate preference influencing the mating success of males in the wild. When combined with previous results demonstrating a correlation between female size distribution and frequency of the two types of males across populations, our results suggest that variation in female preference helps to promote variation in male alternative mating behaviours, and ultimately heritable variation in male traits. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","male mating success; sexual selection; swordtail; variation in mate preference; Xiphophorus multilineatus","fish; mate choice; mating success; sexual selection; size distribution; wild population; Xiphophorus multilineatus",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection.

The information transmitted through secondary channels may be mostly useless, redundant, complementary, or essential. Although each option implies different evolutionary scenarios, the relative role of signal subcomponents in a secondary channel has rarely been tested. Anuran amphibians are known for their extensive use of auditory signals, but growing evidence suggests their common use of multimodal signals where the visual component represents the secondary channel. Territorial males of the nontoxic frog Allobates femoralis use bimodal (acoustic + visual) signals to recognize conspecific intruders. We used playback experiments to test the relative importance of three visual subcomponents (body coloration, body size and body movement) in a multimodal signal to elicit agonistic reactions in males. The probability of attack was highly related to the movement and size of a dummy frog but very poorly related to dummy's coloration. The results suggest that any body movement, and not only vocal sac movement, is a nonredundant component of a bimodal signal that probably modulates male aggression. Against our expectations, males readily attacked dummy frogs painted to mimic the co-occurring frog Ameerega trivittata as well as models lacking some of their own pattern's subcomponents (white lines and yellow patches). Colourful frogs did not use body coloration as a visual cue for conspecific recognition. Both patterns recall the importance of carefully manipulating the availability of visual information in interpreting the origin and evolution of multimodal signals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Allobates femoralis; body coloration; multimodal communication; playback; visual cue","color morph; communication behavior; conspecific; frog; visual cue; Amphibia; Anura; Epipedobates femoralis",,,,,,"Acquistapace, P., Aquiloni, L., Hazlett, B.A., Gherardi, F., Multimodal communication in crayfish: sex recognition during mate search by male Austropotamobius pallipes (2002) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 80, pp. 2041-2045; Aichinger, M., Annual activity patterns of anurans in a seasonal Neotropical environment (1987) Oecologia, 71, pp. 583-592; Amézquita, A., Castellanos, L., Hödl, W., Auditory matching of male Epipedobates femoralis (Anura: Dendrobatidae) under field conditions (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 1377-1386; Amézquita, A., Hödl, W., Lima, A., Castellanos, L., Erdtmann, L., de Araújo, M.C., Masking interference and the evolution of the acoustic communication system in the Amazonian dendrobatid frog Allobates femoralis (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 1874-1887; Bee, M.A., Perrill, S.A., Owen, P.C., Size assessment in simulated territorial encounters between male green frogs (Rana clamitans) (1999) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 45, pp. 177-184; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principles of Animal Communication, , Sinauer, Sunderland, Massachusetts; Daly, J.W., Myers, C.W., Whittaker, N., Further classification of skin alkaloids from Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae), with a general survey of toxic noxious substances in the Amphibia (1987) Toxicon, 25, pp. 1023-1095; Darst, C., A mechanism for diversity in warning signals: conspicuousness versus toxicity in poison frogs (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 103, pp. 5852-5857; Davies, N.B., Halliday, T.R., Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads Bufo bufo (1978) Nature, 274, pp. 683-685; Enquist, M., Arak, A., Selection of exaggerated male traits by female aesthetic senses (1993) Nature, 361, pp. 446-448; Gasser, H., Amézquita, A., Hödl, W., Who is calling?

To test whether USVs play a role in sexual courtship, we examined how males produce USVs following exposure to scent from conspecifics of different sexes and ages, and also females' attraction to recorded playbacks of males' USVs. We studied wild-derived house mice (F1 from wild-caught Mus musculus musculus) since previous work has almost exclusively been on domesticated strains. Males produced USVs in response to female but not to male or immature female urinary scent, and males responded at a higher rate to urine from novel than familiar females. Males' prior social experience had no effect on their USV responses to fresh female urine, corroborating studies with laboratory mice. When presented with playbacks, females were more attracted to USVs of novel males, and showed a preference for unfamiliar nonkin versus familiar siblings. Our results support the idea that male USVs function as courtship behaviour to attract mates, and extend several previous findings on laboratory strains to wild house mice. We also show that USVs are highly diverse among males, but further experiments are needed to determine whether these vocalizations play a role in social (individual, sibling or kin) recognition, inbreeding avoidance or other forms of mate choice. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Mus musculus musculus; sexual selection; social recognition; ultrasonic vocalization; wild house mouse","courtship; rodent; sexual selection; ultrasonics; vocalization; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus musculus musculus",,,,,,"Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Batty, J., Plasma levels of testosterone and male sexual behaviour in strains of the house mouse (Mus musculus) (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 339-348; Batty, J., Acute changes in plasma testosterone levels and their relation to measures of sexual behaviour in the male house mouse (Mus musculus) (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 349-357; Crawley, J.N., Belknap, J.K., Collins, A., Crabbe, J.C., Frankel, W., Henderson, N., Hitzemann, R.J., Paylor, R., Behavioral phenotypes of inbred mouse strains: implications and recommendations for molecular studies (1997) Psychopharmacology, 132, pp. 107-124; D'Amato, F.R., Moles, A., Ultrasonic vocalizations as an index of social memory in female mice (2001) Behavioral Neuroscience, 115, pp. 834-840; Dewsbury, D.A., Effects of novelty of copulatory behavior: the Coolidge effect and related phenomena (1981) Psychological Bulletin, 89, pp. 464-482; Dizinno, G., Whitney, G., Androgen influence on male mouse ultrasounds during courtship (1977) Hormones and Behavior, 8, pp. 188-192; Dizinno, G., Whitney, G., Ultrasonic vocalizations by male mice to female sex pheromone: experiential determinants (1978) Behavioral Biology, 22, pp. 104-113; Duffy, D.L., Ball, G.F., Song predicts immunocompetence in male European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 847-852; Ehret, G., Age-dependent hearing loss in normal hearing mice (1974) Naturwissenschaften, 61, pp. 506-507; Flowerdew, J.R., (1987) Mammals: Their Reproductive Biology and Population Ecology, , Edward Arnold, London; Gil, D., Gahr, M., The honesty of bird song: multiple constraints for multiple traits (2002) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 17, pp. 133-141; Grafen, A., Do animals really recognize kin?

Animals show varieties of different foraging strategies, each adapted to particular ecological and physical constraints. For example, while both the paddlefish and the zooplankton Daphnia filter-feed on patchy food sources, they differ greatly in size and in their methods of propulsion, affecting the degrees of influence of the viscous and inertial forces on these swimmers. To examine the effects of these physical constraints on the evolution of foraging strategies, we modified a recent evolution simulation designed for Daphnia by adding an energy penalty proportional to each turning angle used by modelled foraging agents. This modification accounts for the loss of linear momentum of larger swimmers as they change directions, directly contrasting with Daphnia, which, as smaller, rowing organisms, never build an appreciable momentum since they are halted by the surrounding medium after each forward stroke. While realistic random-walk-like trajectories were predicted by the simulation for Daphnia, distinct circling trajectories and nonzero peaks in the turning angle distributions were predicted for larger species, such as paddlefish. These results are strikingly similar to experimental data also reported here: the circling patterns and bimodal turning angle distributions observed in juvenile paddlefish. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aquatic species; Daphnia; evolution model; filter feeder; foraging strategy; momentum; paddlefish; propulsion; turning angle","evolutionary biology; fitness; foraging behavior; juvenile; life history trait; momentum; simulation; zooplankton; Animalia; Daphnia; Polyodontidae (fish)",,,,,,"Bartumeus, F., Peters, F., Pueyo, S., Marrasé, C., Catalan, J., Helical Lévy walks: adjusting searching statistics to resource availability in microzooplankton (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 100, pp. 12771-12775; Batty, R.S., Blaxter, J.H.S., Libby, D.A., Herring (Clupea harengus) filter-feeding in the dark (1986) Marine Biology, 91, pp. 371-375; Boisclair, D., Tang, M., Empirical analysis of the influence of swimming pattern on the net energetic cost of swimming in fishes (1993) Journal of Fish Biology, 42, pp. 169-183; Boyer, D., Ramos-Fernández, G., Miramontes, O., Mateos, J.L., Cocho, G., Larralde, H., Ramos, H., Rojas, F., Scale-free foraging by primates emerges from their interaction with a complex environment (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 1743-1750; Burggren, W.W., Bemis, W.E., Metabolism and ram gill ventilation in juvenile paddlefish, Polyodon spathula (Chondrostei: Polyodontidae) (1992) Physiological Zoology, 65, pp. 515-539; Catton, K.B., Webster, D.R., Brown, J., Yen, J., Quantitative analysis of tethered and free-swimming copepodid flow fields (2007) Journal of Experimental Biology, 210, pp. 299-310; Daniel, T.L., Jordan, C., Grunbaum, D., Hydromechanics of swimming (1992) Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology, 11, pp. 17-49. , Alexander R.Mc.N.

The number of eggs laid per seed and the number of larvae hatched from the eggs are important determinants of whether larval behaviour within the seed will be of the scramble or the contest type. In maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais, few adults emerge per seed regardless of the number of eggs laid, which may arise from scramble competition, if the optimum egg density (i.e. egg density leading to maximum total larval fitness) is low compared to the number of eggs laid per seed, or from contest competition due to direct interference among the larvae. The behavioural process and the ecological outcome of competition were assessed in two strains of the maize weevil. Neither strain showed a reduction in body mass with increased competition, and they had similar optimal egg densities (two eggs per seed). There was a hump in the larval fitness curve suggesting a scramble competition, but this conclusion is compromised because the optimum egg density was small (two eggs per seed). X-ray imaging of seeds was used to observe interactions of larvae within the seed and showed direct interference, with aggression among the larvae. This provides evidence of contest-like competition within seeds even when egg density was low. Hence, one should be cautious in inferring the underlying type of competitive behaviour from variables such as body mass and initial egg density per seed. Direct observation of behaviour is required to make such an inference. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","competition strategy; Curculionidae; interaction; intraspecific competition; life-history trait; maize weevil; resource monopolization; scramble competition; Sitophilus zeamais; Zea mays","beetle; body mass; food limitation; intraspecific competition; life history trait; maize; X-ray spectroscopy; Arthropoda; Curculionidae; Hexapoda; Sitophilus zeamais; Zea mays",,,,,,"Alves-Costa, C., Knogge, C., Larval competition in weevils Revena rubiginosa (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) preying on seeds of the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana (Arecaceae) (2005) Naturwissenschaften, 92, pp. 265-268; Anderson, M., Natural selection of offspring numbers: some possible intergeneration effects (1978) American Naturalist, 112, pp. 762-766; Araújo, R.A., Guedes, R.N.C., Oliveira, M.G.A., Ferreira, G.H., Enhanced activity of carbohydrate- and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in insecticide-resistant populations of the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (2008) Bulletin of Entomological Research, 98, pp. 417-424; Bakker, K., An analysis of factors which determine success in competition for food among larvae of Drosophila melanogaster (1961) Archives Néerlandaises de Zöologie, 2, pp. 250-281; Bellows, T.S., Analytical models for laboratory populations of Callosobruchus chinensis and Callosobruchus maculatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) (1982) Journal of Animal Ecology, 51, pp. 263-287; Campbell, J.F., Influence of seed size on exploitation by the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (2002) Journal of Insect Behavior, 15, pp. 429-445; Colegrave, N., Game theory models of competition in closed systems: asymmetries in fighting and competitive ability (1994) Oikos, 71, pp. 499-505; Colegrave, N., Can a patchy population structure affect the evolution of competition strategies?

We investigated the use of chemical signals during courtship in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Males of P. xylostella have a hair-pencil gland on the tip of their abdomen, which allows for the release of chemical signals during courtship. Males detected potential competitors using chemical signals, but male investment in sexual signalling did not increase linearly in the presence of increasing numbers of competitors. The patterns of male display and mating behaviour among the parental population were not necessarily replicated among the next generation of males. Males of the parental generation that were exposed to one male competitor were more likely to display their hair-pencil than males exposed to zero or two competitors, but the display behaviour of the next generation of males (while higher overall) did not vary significantly across these treatments. Furthermore, males of the parental generation that acquired matings displayed their hair-pencil at a higher rate than males that did not obtain matings; again this pattern was not evident among the next generation of males. Finally, sons tended to be more likely to display their hair-pencil, and were significantly more likely to achieve a successful mating, than the previous generation of males. These intergenerational patterns suggest that the tendency to achieve copulations may have a genetic component.

Fleeing in response to nonurgent alarms, such as those given for distant predators, wastes time and energy and so individuals could benefit from decoding information about urgency. White-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, and superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, flee in response to each other's aerial alarm calls, and scrubwrens communicate urgency by including more elements in their alarms when a threat is closer. We carried out a model-presentation experiment to test whether fairy-wren alarm calls also encode risk-based information, followed by a playback experiment to compare how fairy-wrens and scrubwrens respond to graded information in both their own calls and those of the other species. Fairy-wrens encoded urgency in a way similar to that of scrubwrens, by including more elements when the model predator was closer and by increasing the maximum frequency of elements. Each species was more likely to flee in response to both conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls that included more elements. Fairy-wrens were more likely than scrubwrens to flee regardless of call urgency, particularly when responding to their own species' calls, perhaps because they are more vulnerable to predators or because they use a different scale for decoding risk-based information. Fairy-wrens also spent more time in cover after fleeing multielement conspecific calls with a greater number of elements. Our study reveals that urgency information in the form of graded alarm call variants can be transferred through mutual eavesdropping between bird species. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic communication; alarm call; interspecific eavesdropping; Malurus cyaneus; Sericornis frontalis; superb fairy-wren; white-browed scrubwren","behavioral response; conspecific; intraspecific interaction; passerine; Aves; Malurus cyaneus; Sericornis frontalis; Troglodytinae",,,,,,"Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., (1998) Principles of Animal Communication, , Sinauer, Sunderland, Massachusetts; Charif, R.A., Waack, A.M., Strickman, L.M., (2008) Raven Pro 1.3 User's Manual, , Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York; Cockburn, A., Osmond, H.L., Mulder, R.A., Double, M.C., Green, D.J., Demography of male reproductive queues in cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus (2008) Journal of Animal Ecology, 77, pp. 297-304; Cockburn, A., Sims, R.A., Osmond, H.L., Green, D.J., Double, M.C., Mulder, R.A., Can we measure the benefits of help in cooperatively breeding birds: the case of superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus (2008) Journal of Animal Ecology, 77, pp. 430-438; Dolby, A.S., Grubb Jr., T.C., Social context affects risk taking by a satellite species in a mixed-species foraging group (2000) Behavioral Ecology, 11, pp. 110-114; Ficken, M.S., Vocal repertoire of the Mexican chickadee.

Previously, we found that females of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii eavesdrop on two fighting males before choosing the winner. Here, we asked whether eavesdropping females use vision together with smell to do so and whether their preference for the winner relies on a form of individual, rather than on status, recognition. When tested in a two-way choice paradigm, a bystander female visited the dominant first rather than the subordinate male, remained in his proximity for longer, and interacted with him more frequently. However, this happened only when she was offered the same individuals she had previously watched and smelled. This suggests that females recognize the winners as individuals and not as generic dominants, thus revealing unusual discrimination abilities in an invertebrate. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","bimodal communication; crayfish social eavesdropping; individual recognition; invertebrate; mate choice; Procambarus clarkii","bimodal association; crayfish; freshwater ecosystem; mate choice; paradigm shift; Animalia; Astacoidea; Invertebrata; Procambarus clarkii",,,,,,"Acquistapace, P., Aquiloni, L., Hazlett, B.A., Gherardi, F., Multimodal communication in crayfish: sex recognition during mate search by male Austropotamobius pallipes (2002) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 80, pp. 2041-2045; Aquiloni, L., Gherardi, F., Assessing mate size in the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii: effects of visual versus chemical stimuli (2008) Freshwater Biology, 53, pp. 461-469; Aquiloni, L., Gherardi, F., Mutual mate choice in crayfish: large body size is selected by both sexes, virginity by males only (2008) Journal of Zoology, 274, pp. 171-179; Aquiloni, L., Buřič, M., Gherardi, F., Crayfish females eavesdrop on fighting males before choosing the dominant mate (2008) Current Biology, 18, pp. 462-463; Aquiloni, L., Massolo, A., Gherardi, F., Sex identification in female crayfish is bimodal (2009) Naturwissenschaften, 9, pp. 103-110; Atema, J., Cobb, J.S., Social behaviour (1980) The Biology and Management of Lobsters, pp. 409-450. , Cobb J.S., and Phillips B.F.

In particular, this species has played a key role in developing our understanding of sexual selection and sperm competition. In contrast with the large number of studies using domesticated zebra finches, relatively few studies have focused on free-living populations of wild zebra finches. Investigating the incidence of extrapair paternity in zebra finches in the Australian desert, we found a very low level; 1.7% of 316 offspring from four of 80 broods fathered outside the pair bond. These numbers contrast with the high levels of extrapair paternity observed in domesticated aviary populations, and suggest a low level of sperm competition and sexual selection in natural populations. Our finding of such a low rate of extrapair paternity in the wild zebra finch suggests that it is one of the most genetically monogamous of all passerine species and that has important implications for future studies of this model organism in studies of sexual selection and reproductive biology. In addition, we found that 5.4% of 316 offspring were not related to either putative parent and hatched from eggs that had been dumped by intraspecific brood parasites. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","extrapair paternity; intraspecific brood parasitism; sexual conflict; sexual selection; sperm competition; Taeniopygia guttata; zebra finch","brood parasitism; extra-pair copulation; intraspecific interaction; passerine; sexual behavior; sexual conflict; sexual selection; sperm competition; Australia; Passeriformes; Taeniopygia guttata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Birkhead, T.R., Fletcher, F., Male phenotype and ejaculate quality in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 262, pp. 329-334; Birkhead, T.R., Clarkson, K., Zann, R., Extra-pair courtship, copulation and mate guarding in wild zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata (1988) Animal Behaviour, 36, pp. 1853-1855; Birkhead, T.R., Pellatt, J., Hunter, F.M., Extra-pair copulation and sperm competition in the zebra finch (1988) Nature, 334, pp. 60-62; Birkhead, T.R., Hunter, F.M., Pellatt, J.E., Sperm competition in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 935-950; Birkhead, T.R., Burke, T., Zann, R., Hunter, F.M., Krupa, A.P., Extra-pair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism in wild zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, revealed by DNA fingerprinting (1990) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 27, pp. 315-324; Birkhead, T.R., Pellatt, E.J., Fletcher, F., Selection and utilization of spermatozoa in the reproductive tract of the female zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata (1993) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 99, pp. 593-600; Birkhead, T.R., Pellatt, E.J., Brekke, P., Yeates, R., Castillo-Juarez, H., Genetic effects on sperm design in the zebra finch (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 383-387; Burley, N., Sex-ratio manipulation and selection for attractiveness (1981) Science, 211, pp. 721-722; Burley, N., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Burley, N.T., Parker, P.G., Lundy, K., Sexual selection and extrapair fertilization in a socially monogamous passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) (1996) Behavioral Ecology, 7, pp. 218-226; Burley, N.T., Enstrom, D.A., Chitwood, L., Extra-pair relations in zebra finches: differential male success results from female tactics (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 1031-1041; Colegrave, N., Birkhead, T.R., Lessells, C.M., Sperm precedence in zebra finches does not require special mechanisms of sperm competition (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 259, pp. 223-228; Collins, S.A., Hubbard, C., Houtman, A.M., Female mate choice in the zebra finch: the effect of male beak color and male song (1994) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 35, pp. 21-25; Forstmeier, W., Do individual females differ intrinsically in their propensity to engage in extra-pair copulations?

We analysed the contribution of intrinsic factors (body weight, behaviour), size of the nuts and the anvil surface (flat or pit) to the efficiency of cracking. We provided capuchins with local palm nuts and a single hammer stone at an anvil. From video we scored the capuchins' position and actions with the nut prior to each strike, and outcomes of each strike. The most efficient capuchin opened 15 nuts per 100 strikes (6.6 strikes per nut). The least efficient capuchin that succeeded in opening a nut opened 1.32 nuts per 100 strikes (more than 75 strikes per nut). Body weight and diameter of the nut best predicted whether a capuchin would crack a nut on a given strike. All the capuchins consistently placed nuts into pits. To provide an independent analysis of the effect of placing the nut into a pit, we filmed an adult human cracking nuts on the same anvil using the same stone. The human displaced the nut on proportionally fewer strikes when he placed it into a pit rather than on a flat surface. Thus the capuchins placed the nut in a more effective location on the anvil to crack it. Nut cracking as practised by bearded capuchins is a striking example of a plastic behaviour where costs and benefits vary enormously across individuals, and where efficiency requires years to attain. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","anvil; body weight; capuchin; Cebus libidinosus; efficiency; hammer stone; human; nut cracking; palm nut; tool use","behavioral ecology; body mass; field survey; nut; primate; Cebidae; Cebus; Cebus libidinosus",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Alberts, S., Body mass and growth rates in a wild primate population (1987) Oecologia, 72, pp. 15-20; Altmann, S.A., (1998) Foraging for Survival: Yearling Baboons in Africa, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Araújo, A., Arruda, M., Alencar, A., Albuquerque, F., Nascimento, M., Yamamoto, M., Body weight of wild and captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (2000) International Journal of Primatology, 21, pp. 317-324; Beck, B., (1980) Animal Tool Behavior: the Use and Manufacture of Tools by Animals, , Garland STPM Press, New York; Boesch, C., Achermann-Boesch, H., (2000) The Chimpanzees of the Taï Forest, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Canale, G.R., Guidorizzi, C.E., Kierulff, M.C.M., Gatto, C.A.F.R., First record of tool use by wild populations of the yellow-breasted capuchin monkey (Cebus xanthosternos) and new records for the bearded capuchin (Cebus libidinosus) (2009) American Journal of Primatology, 71, pp. 366-372; Chalk, J., Wright, B., Lucas, P., Verderane, M., Fragaszy, D., Visalberghi, E., Izar, P., Ottoni, E., The mechanical properties of foods processed by Cebus libidinosus at Boa Vista, Brazil (2008) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Supplement, 46, p. 77; Cohen, P., Cohen, J., West, S., Aiken, L., (2003) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation for the Behavioral Sciences. 3rd edn, , L.

However, in the wild it generally takes 2 years for cowbirds to reach this stage. We have postulated that a crucial step in this protracted development involves a sensory learning phase during a male's first breeding season when he memorizes de novo many of his adult songs. To test this hypothesis, we exposed yearling cowbirds that had been housed in acoustic isolation since being taken from the wild as juveniles to different song culture environments. One cohort of yearlings was housed with adult males (tutors) from the Mammoth Lakes, California, U.S.A., dialect (Mam) where the juveniles had been trapped, while another cohort was housed with adults from an unfamiliar dialect, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A. (SB). One year later when the tutee birds were recorded as 2-year-old adults, all 10 males in the Mam cohort had developed song repertoires typical of adults in the Mam dialect. In contrast, only 1 of 11 SB males had a single Mam song. Four of the SB cohort produced copies of their SB tutors' songs while the majority of SB tutees produced new song types that were shared exclusively by the SB tutees in 2007. The current results offer new experimental evidence to support our model for delayed vocal development in wild cowbirds based on environmental constraints that can also affect vocal ontogeny in other songbirds. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","brown-headed cowbird; development; dialect; learning; memorization; Molothrus ater; song","breeding season; cohort analysis; developmental stage; learning; memory; song; songbird; Aves; Molothrus; Molothrus ater; Passeri",,,,,,"Anderson, K.E., Rothstein, S.I., Fleischer, R.C., O'Loghlen, A.L., Large-scale movement patterns between song dialects in brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) (2005) Auk, 122, pp. 803-818; Baptista, L.F., Petrinovich, L., Social interaction, sensitive phases and the song template hypothesis in the white-crowned sparrow (1984) Animal Behaviour, 32, pp. 172-181; Beecher, M.D., Birdsong learning in the laboratory and field (1996) Ecology and Evolution of Acoustic Communication in Birds, pp. 61-78. , Kroodsma D.E., and Miller E.H.

The possibility that insects may use the same compounds in a different context as nonhost cues has received relatively little attention. Volatiles normally emitted by the host but encountered without other host volatiles could theoretically function as nonhost cues. We hypothesized that insects might show a positive response to host volatile compounds when encountered together in a blend but avoid the same volatiles when encountered individually. To test this we examined the behavioural responses of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, to physiologically relevant doses of volatile compounds emitted by its host, Vicia faba, which had been previously implicated in host recognition. Of 15 volatiles tested for behavioural activity, 10 caused aphids to respond negatively, suggesting they were repellent. We then made a blend comprising each of these compounds at the concentration at which they elicited the most negative behavioural response. The resultant blend elicited a positive response, suggesting it was attractive/arrestant. This demonstrated that the same volatile compounds can function as both host and nonhost cues, depending upon the context in which they are perceived. Thus, background odour context needs to be considered for successful use of behaviourally active volatile compounds in integrated pest management strategies. Furthermore, the finding that odorants are perceived differently when combined suggests that there is an emergent property of odour perception whereby discrimination of odour quality can occur according to blend properties. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aphis fabae; attractant; black bean aphid; insect host location; nonhost recognition; odour blend; olfaction; repellent","aphid; attractant; behavioral response; olfactory cue; physiological response; plant defense; plant-herbivore interaction; repellent; volatile element; Aphididae; Aphis fabae; Hexapoda; Vicia faba",,,,,,"Agelopoulos, N.G., Birkett, M.A., Hick, A.J., Hooper, A.M., Pickett, J.A., Pow, E.M., Smart, L.E., Woodcock, C.M., Exploiting semiochemicals in insect control (1999) Pesticide Science, 55, pp. 225-235; Agelopoulos, N.G., Hooper, A.M., Maniar, S.P., Pickett, J.A., Wadhams, L.J., A novel approach for isolation of volatile chemicals released by individual leaves of a plant in situ (1999) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 25, pp. 1411-1425; Bruce, T.J.A., Wadhams, L.J., Woodcock, C.M., Insect host location: a volatile situation (2005) Trends in Plant Science, 10, pp. 269-274; Bruce, T.J.A., Birkett, M.A., Blande, J., Hooper, A.M., Martin, J.L., Khambay, B., Prosser, I., Wadhams, L.J., Response of economically important aphids to components of Hemizygia petiolata essential oil (2005) Pest Management Science, 61, pp. 1115-1121; Cammell, M.E., The black bean aphid, Aphis fabae (1981) Biologist, 28, pp. 247-258; Coracini, M., Bengtsson, M., Liblikas, I., Witzgall, P., Attraction of codling moth males to apple volatiles (2004) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 110, pp. 1-10; Eisthen, H., Why are olfactory systems similar across phyla?

We examined the grooming patterns of dominant males in groups of cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, to test the hypothesis that the distribution of grooming reflects the value of social relationships. Grooming between dominant individuals was the most commonly observed interaction. Grooming by the dominant male was less common when the dominant female was in oestrus. Grooming between dominant males and subordinates was asymmetrical, with dominant males receiving more grooming and providing less grooming to subordinates. Because subordinate males defend the group against extragroup males, the dominant male was predicted to groom subordinate males more often than to groom subordinate females. Although the sex of a subordinate did not affect the probability of grooming occurring, dominant males groomed subordinate males for longer than they groomed subordinate females. The duration of grooming by a dominant male was longer in small groups than large groups, suggesting that grooming activity is constrained by time. In contrast, subordinates groomed dominant males for longer in larger groups, and as a result, the asymmetry of grooming exchanges was exaggerated in larger groups. This result is consistent with the biological market theory, which predicts that the value of subordinates is dependent on group size and that subordinates will alter grooming efforts accordingly. These results suggest that meerkat grooming serves several social functions, such as the maintenance of valuable and/or fitness-enhancing relationships. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","cooperative breeding; grooming; meerkat; social relationship; Suricata suricatta","breeding population; grooming; hypothesis testing; mammal; probability; social behavior; Mammalia; Suricata suricatta",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-265; Aureli, F., Preston, S.D., de Waal, F.B.M., Heart rate responses to social interactions in free-moving rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): a pilot study (1999) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 113, pp. 59-65; Barrett, L., Henzi, S.P., Monkeys, markets and minds: biological markets and primate sociality (2006) Cooperation in Primates and Humans: Mechanisms and Evolution, pp. 209-232. , Kappeler P.M., and van Schaik C.P.

We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioural syndrome; common principal components analysis; personality; population differentiation; structural equation modelling; variance-covariance matrix","aggression; behavioral response; correlation; covariance analysis; data set; marine ecosystem; principal component analysis; teleost; variance analysis; Gasterosteus aculeatus",,,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , Petran B.N., and Csáki F.

Here, we investigated how a change in turbidity would affect the ability of fathead minnows to recognize potential predators. Minnows were taught to recognize the sight of predatory brown trout and were subsequently tested for their responses to brown trout, rainbow trout or yellow perch in either clear or turbid conditions. In clear water, minnows exhibited an antipredator response towards the brown trout, but they also generalized their recognition to a novel rainbow trout. In turbid water, however, the responses of minnows towards brown trout were lessened and they did not exhibit an antipredator response to the sight of a rainbow trout. None of the minnows displayed a response upon presentation of yellow perch. These results indicate that turbidity alters the quality and quantity of visual information received by the minnows, eliminating their ability to generalize learned recognition of some predators. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","antipredator behaviour; ecological constraint; fathead minnow; generalization; learning; Pimephales promelas; predator recognition; turbidity","antipredator defense; cyprinid; ecological approach; freshwater ecosystem; learning; turbidity; Animalia; Cyprinidae; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Perca; Pimephales promelas; Salmo trutta",,,,,,"Bilotta, G.S., Brazier, R.E., Understanding the influence of suspended solids on water quality and aquatic biota (2008) Water Research, 42, pp. 2849-2861; Bonner, T.H., Wilde, G.R., Effects of turbidity on prey consumption by prairie stream fishes (2002) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 131, pp. 1203-1208; Chivers, D.P., Smith, R.J.F., Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, acquire predator recognition when alarm substance is associated with the sight of unfamiliar fish (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 597-605; Chivers, D.P., Smith, R.J.F., The role of experience and chemical alarm signalling in predator recognition by fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas (1994) Journal of Fish Biology, 44, pp. 273-285; Davies-Colley, R.J., Smith, D.G., Turbidity, suspended sediment, and water clarity: a review (2001) Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 37, pp. 1085-1101; Ferrari, M.C.O., Trowell, J.J., Brown, G.E., Chivers, D.P., The role of learning in the development of threat-sensitive predator avoidance by fathead minnows (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 777-784; Ferrari, M.C.O., Gonzalo, A., Messier, F., Chivers, D.P., Generalization of learned predator recognition: an experimental test and framework for future studies (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 1853-1859; Ferrari, M.C.O., Messier, F., Chivers, D.P., Can prey exhibit threat-sensitive generalization of predator recognition?

Many studies have, therefore, investigated the ecological correlates of time allocated to travelling, foraging and vigilance. However, animals spend more time inactive than active, and understanding the determinants of this resting time may provide new insights into the habitat-specific time-budgeting problems that animals face. We analysed the environmental constraints that determine the minimum amount of daytime an average primate has to spend resting, using data from a wide range of ecologically different species. However, total resting time consists of two components: enforced resting time (imposed on the animal by ecological constraints) and free resting time (the time available for allocation to ecologically functional activities). We show that the ecologically important enforced resting time is determined by diet and annual temperature as well as by temperature variation. Our tests of the biological significance of this relationship show that enforced resting time distinguishes between locations that are suitable or unsuitable for particular genera. We show that an annual temperature increase of 2-4 °C would greatly increase enforced resting time, leading to serious time-budgeting problems for many species. The effect of changes to enforced resting time on the biogeographical distribution of species is especially strong for folivorous primates. This study shows that resting time is an important component of animal behaviour that can help us understand extinction risk and geographical distribution of taxa. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","biogeographical distribution; climate change; ecological model; monkey; primates; resting time; temperature variation; time budget","behavioral ecology; biogeographical region; climate change; ecological modeling; extinction risk; geographical distribution; primate; survival; temperature effect; Animalia; Primates",,,,,,"Ahsan, M.F., Socio-ecology of the hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock) in two forests of Bangladesh (2001) Proceedings from 'The Apes: Challenges for the 21st Century', pp. 286-299. , Zoo B.

Such learning facilitates, for example, acquisition of responses to novel predators and has the functional advantage that individuals avoid exposing themselves to a potentially risky situation. Avoidance of potential danger might equally apply to learning about risky places, but would require social alarm signals to trigger learning about contextual cues, rather than discrete stimuli. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analysing the behaviour of experimental observer Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, both before and after they had watched demonstrator mynahs showing alarm behaviour at a foraging site where observers were accustomed to feeding. To isolate changes specifically attributable to the behaviour of demonstrators, we compared this group's post-training behaviour with that of a control group, which watched social companions foraging at the feeding site. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that experimental observers became more wary of the feeding site after observational training relative to control observers, suggesting that social alarm signals do not trigger learning about the location in which an alarmed individual is observed. In light of previous work in our laboratory showing that Indian mynahs become more wary in a place in which they have observed a predator attack on a social companion, we suggest that social learning about places may require observation of both social alarm and its cause.

As strangers are usually 'floating' individuals seeking to acquire a territory they pose a relatively greater threat to a resident than do neighbours, who are already territory owners. This explains why residents are less aggressive towards neighbours but not how they distinguish neighbours from strangers: do residents recognize their neighbours or respond to differences in the behaviour of neighbours and strangers? Using measures of fighting intensity we investigated the dear enemy effect in a fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi. We then experimentally manipulated the residency status of pairs of neighbours to distinguish between mechanisms enabling the dear enemy response. Fights between resident and nonterritory-owning individuals were longer and more escalated than fights between neighbouring residents, whether the nonterritory-owner was familiar (a former neighbour) or unfamiliar to the resident. Our results are consistent with the 'relative threat' hypothesis to explain the dear enemy effect, and support the suggestion that residents use cues in the behaviour of an intruder to determine the level of threat posed and distinguish between neighbours and strangers. However, we note that the observed patterns can occur even if residents do not differentiate between intruder types, and simply respond appropriately to the aggressiveness and persistence of an intruder. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","dear enemy; fiddler crab; floater; neighbour; relative threat; stranger; territory; Uca mjoebergi","aggression; behavioral response; crab; defense behavior; Decapoda (Crustacea); Ocypodidae; Uca",,,,,,"Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Backwell, P.R.Y., Jennions, M.D., Coalition among male fiddler crabs (2004) Nature, 430, p. 417; Briefer, E., Rybak, F., Aubin, T., When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1319-1325; Crane, J., (1975) Fiddler Crabs of the World, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; delBarco-Trillo, J., McPhee, M.E., Johnston, R.E., Nonagonistic familiarity decreases aggression in male Turkish hamsters, Mesocricetus brandti (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 389-393; Enquist, M., Leimar, O., Evolution of fighting behaviour: decision rules and assessment of relative strength (1983) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 102, pp. 387-410; Fayed, S.A., Jennions, M.D., Backwell, P.R.Y., What factors contribute to the ownership advantage?

I tested whether learning shapes the expression and timing of escape behaviour of native lizards to invasive fire ants. Fence lizards survive encounters with fire ants by body twitching to remove stinging ants and fleeing the source of attack. I found that adult lizards from invaded sites body-twitched more frequently and fled sooner than did lizards from uninvaded sites, minimizing their exposure to envenomation. Juveniles' small size makes them more vulnerable to fire ants, and they fled rapidly from encounters, irrespective of their site of origin. A higher percentage of adult lizards body-twitched and fled, and they fled sooner, with repeated exposure to fire ants over 4 days, and lizards that had been repeatedly exposed to fire ants fled sooner than did control-conditioned lizards. These results suggest that adult lizards may learn to flee more rapidly after repeated encounters with fire ants. However, the percentage of lizards that performed this behaviour appeared to be driven by aspects of the testing procedure other than the presence of fire ants, as the percentage of lizards that fled or body-twitched in response to fire ants was not affected by prior fire ant conditioning. These results suggest that adult lizards cannot learn to show escape behaviour with repeated exposure to fire ants, but that they can optimize this behaviour by fleeing sooner. This study highlights the need to test alternative explanations rigorously for apparent learned behaviour. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggressive; behaviour; fence lizard; fire ant; habituation; invasion; learning; Sceloporus undulatus; Solenopsis invicta; stress","aggression; ant; escape behavior; habituation; invasive species; juvenile; lizard; Formicidae; Sceloporus undulatus; Solenopsis geminata; Solenopsis invicta; Squamata",,,,,,"Agin, V., Chichery, R., Dickel, L., Chichery, M.-P., The 'prawn-in-the-tube' procedure in the cuttlefish: habituation or passive avoidance learning?

We examined the effect of group size on pup production and survival across age classes in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, across 12 quasiexperimental sites in South Africa varying in ecological conditions. In this sample spanning over 43 pack-years, group size had a significantly positive effect on litter size after emergence from the den, but not on number of pups surviving to 1 year of age or survival rates for pups, yearlings and adults. Stronger relationships between these variables have been reported in other samples, so these results might be explained by low competitor density and high prey availability in our study areas. This explanation is supported by the finding that neither of these variables had any significant effect on pup production and survival across age classes in the present study. The results of our quasiexperimental study suggest that varying ecological conditions represent an important source of intraspecific variation in the impact of helpers in cooperative breeders. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","African wild dog; Allee effect; cooperative breeding; ecological condition; group size; helper; intraspecific variation; Lycaon pictus","Allee effect; canid; cooperative breeding; fitness; group size; intraspecific variation; prey availability; survival; South Africa; Canis familiaris; Lycaon pictus",,,,,,"Brown, J.L., (1987) Helping and Communal Breeding in Birds: Ecology and Evolution, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Buettner, U.K., Davies-Mostert, H.T., Du Toit, J.T., Mills, M.G.L., Factors affecting juvenile survival in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Kruger National Park, South Africa (2007) Journal of Zoology, 272, pp. 10-19; Clutton-Brock, T., Breeding together: kin selection and mutualism in cooperative vertebrates (2002) Science, 296, pp. 69-72; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Gaynor, D., McIlrath, G.M., MacColl, A.D.C., Kansky, R., Chadwick, P., Manser, M., Brotherton, P.N.M., Predation, group size and mortality in a cooperative mongoose, Suricata suricatta (1999) Journal of Animal Ecology, 68, pp. 672-683; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Russell, A.F., Sharpe, L.L., Brotherton, P.N.M., McIlrath, G.M., White, S., Cameron, E.Z., Effects of helpers on juvenile development and survival in meerkats (2001) Science, 293, pp. 2446-2449; Courchamp, F., Macdonald, D.W., Crucial importance of pack size in the African wild dog Lycaon pictus (2001) Animal Conservation, 4, pp. 169-174; Courchamp, F., Grenfell, B., Clutton-Brock, T., Population dynamics of obligate cooperators (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266, pp. 557-563; Courchamp, F., Clutton-Brock, T., Grenfell, B., Multipack dynamics and the Allee effect in the African wild dog, Lycaon pictus (2000) Animal Conservation, 3, pp. 277-285; Courchamp, F., Rasmussen, G.S.A., Macdonald, D.W., Small pack size imposes a trade-off between hunting and pup-guarding in the painted hunting dog Lycaon pictus (2002) Behavioral Ecology, 13, pp. 20-27; Creel, S., Cooperative hunting and group size: assumptions and currencies (1997) Animal Behaviour, 54, pp. 1319-1324; Creel, S.R., Creel, N.M., Energetics, reproductive suppression and obligate communal breeding in carnivores (1991) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 28, pp. 263-270; Creel, S., Creel, N.M., Communal hunting and pack size in African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus (1995) Animal Behaviour, 50, pp. 1325-1339; Creel, S., Creel, N.M., Limitation of African wild dogs by competition with larger carnivores (1996) Conservation Biology, 10, pp. 526-538; Creel, S., Creel, N.M., (2002) The African Wild Dog: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Creel, S., Creel, N.M., Monfort, S.L., Birth order, estrogens and sex-ratio adaptation in African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) (1998) Animal Reproduction Science, 53, pp. 315-320; Creel, S., Mills, M.G.L., McNutt, J.W., Demography and population dynamics of African wild dogs in three critical populations (2004) Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids, pp. 337-350. , Macdonald D.W., and Sillero-Zubiri C.

The ontogeny of these social traits is poorly understood. We examined whether increasing exposure to more complex social environments could hone competitive skills and ultimately increase reproductive success in adult brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We created two types of flocks ('Dynamic' and 'Stable') that differed in social complexity. In Dynamic flocks, birds were regularly exchanged across groups, whereas in 'Stable' flocks, the composition of birds remained static throughout a year. Social networking analyses revealed that males in the Dynamic flocks had larger and more variable singing networks during the manipulations than did the males in the Stable flocks. When we put males from the two conditions together into new environments with unfamiliar females, the Dynamic-condition males had greater mating success. Our results establish a link between social competence and reproductive success and suggest that social skills are extremely flexible characteristics, even in adulthood. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","brown-headed cowbird; cowbird; development; mating success; Molothrus ater; social learning","learning; mating success; ontogeny; passerine; reproductive success; social behavior; Aves; Molothrus; Molothrus ater",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Bergman, T.J., Beehner, J.C., Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., Hierarchical classification by rank and kinship in baboons (2003) Science, 302, pp. 1234-1236; Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Freeman, L.C., (2002) Ucinet for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis, , Analytic Technologies, Lexington, Kentucky; Bugnyar, T., Heinrich, B., Pilfering ravens, Corvus corax, adjust their behaviour to social context and identity of competitors (2006) Animal Cognition, 9, pp. 369-376; Byrne, R., Whiten, A., (1988) Machiavellian Intelligence: Social Expertise and the Evolution of Intellect in Monkeys, Apes, and Humans, , Oxford University Press, New York; Byrne, R., Whiten, A., (1997) Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and Evaluations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Catchpole, C.K., Slater, P.J.B., (1995) Bird Song: Biological Themes and Variations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Dufty Jr., A.M., Singing and the establishment and maintenance of dominance hierarchies in captive brown-headed cowbirds (1986) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 19, pp. 49-55; Enquist, M., Leimar, O., Evolution of fighting behaviour: decision rules and assessment of relative strength (1983) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 102, pp. 387-410; Friedmann, H., (1929) The Cowbirds: a Study in the Biology of Social Parasitism, , C.C.

Parents can use a 'switch-off' signal (alarm call) to suppress progeny vocalizations or movement, making chicks less detectable to predators. Alternatively, a 'switch-on' signal (feeding or solicitation call) may be used to initiate a begging display in young by parents. The presence and species specificity of either or both of these signals have rarely been tested, as acoustically similar cues may have evolved amongst avian species. We examined the behavioural and acoustic responses of individual grey warbler, Gerygone igata, nestlings to both feeding and alarm calls at 12 and 16 days of age (nestling period: 17 days) in a sound-isolation chamber. Overall, nestlings consistently reduced the amplitude of begging calls in response to alarm calls, regardless of the developmental stage. Nestlings responded by gaping only to conspecific, and not heterospecific, begging solicitation calls or other acoustic stimuli. After alarm calls, nestlings did not cease begging, but altered the structure of the begging call. Differences in several begging call acoustic structures were also detected between age groups. These patterns are consistent with a trade-off in chicks' signal-specific responses to parental calls, which optimizes the probability of being fed during parental nest visits whilst also reducing predator detection. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alarm call; begging; begging solicitation call; Gerygone igata; grey warbler; parent-offspring communication; vocal communication","begging behavior; behavioral response; nestling; passerine; predation risk; trade-off; vocalization; Aves; Gerygone igata",,,,,,"Benedict, L., Offspring discrimination without recognition: California towhee responses to chick distress calls (2007) Condor, 109, pp. 79-87; Bengtsson, H., Ryden, O., Development of parent young interaction in asynchronously hatched broods of altricial birds (1981) Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie, 56, pp. 255-272; Boncoraglio, G., Saino, N., Barn swallow chicks beg more loudly when broodmates are unrelated (2008) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 21, pp. 256-262; Briskie, J.V., Direct observations of shining cuckoos (Chrysococcyx lucidus) parasitising and depredating grey warbler (Gerygone igata) nests (2007) Notornis, 54, pp. 15-19; Briskie, J.V., Naugler, C.T., Leech, S.M., Begging intensity of nestling birds varies with sibling relatedness (1994) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 258, pp. 73-78; Briskie, J.V., Martin, P.R., Martin, T.E., Nest predation and the evolution of nestling begging calls (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 266, pp. 2153-2159; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Falling on deaf ears: the adaptive significance of begging in the absence of a parent (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 49, pp. 474-481; Chappell, M.A., Bachman, G.C., Energetic costs of begging behaviour (2002) The Evolution of Begging: Competition, Cooperation and Communication, pp. 143-162. , Wright J., and Leonard M.L.

One of the proximate causes of this variation may be that queens produced by multiple-queen colonies are generally smaller, and might thus be unable to found new colonies independently. We examined whether the social origin of queens and males influenced the colony-founding success of queens in the socially polymorphic ant Formica selysi. Queens originating from single-queen and multiple-queen colonies had similar survival rates and colony-founding success, be they alone or in two-queen associations. During the first 5 months, queens originating from single-queen colonies gave rise to more workers than queens originating from multiple-queen colonies. Pairs of queens were also more productive than single queens. However, these differences in productivity were transient, as all types of colonies had reached a similar size after 15 months. Mating between social forms was possible and did not decrease queen survival or colony productivity, compared to mating within social forms. Overall, these results indicate that queens from each social form are able to found colonies independently, at least under laboratory conditions. Moreover, gene flow between social forms is not restricted by mating or genetic incompatibilities. This flexibility in mating and colony founding helps to explain the maintenance of alternative social structures in sympatry and the absence of genetic differentiation between social forms. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","ant; colony founding; dispersal; Formica selysi; queen number; social evolution; social insect; social structure","ant; colony founding; dispersal; genetic differentiation; social behavior; social structure; survival; sympatry; Formica selysi; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Bargum, K., Helantera, H., Sundstrom, L., Genetic population structure, queen supersedure and social polymorphism in a social Hymenoptera (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20, pp. 1351-1360; Bernasconi, G., Keller, L., Reproductive conflicts in cooperative associations of fire ant queens (Solenopsis invicta) (1996) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 263, pp. 509-513; Bernasconi, G., Keller, L., Phenotype and individual investment in cooperative foundress associations of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (1998) Behavioral Ecology, 9, pp. 478-485; Bernasconi, G., Strassmann, J.E., Cooperation among unrelated individuals: the ant foundress case (1999) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 14, pp. 477-482; Bourke, A.F.G., Franks, N.R., (1995) Social Evolution in Ants, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Brown, M.J.F., Bonhoeffer, S., On the evolution of claustral colony founding in ants (2003) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 5, pp. 305-313; Chapuisat, M., Goudet, J., Keller, L., Microsatellites reveal high population viscosity and limited dispersal in the ant Formica paralugubris (1997) Evolution, 51, pp. 475-482; Chapuisat, M., Bocherens, S., Rosset, H., Variable queen number in ant colonies: no impact on queen turnover, inbreeding, and population genetic differentiation in the ant Formica selysi (2004) Evolution, 58, pp. 1064-1072; D'Ettorre, P., Kellner, K., Delabie, J.H.C., Heinze, J., Number of queens in founding associations of the ponerine ant Pachycondyla villosa (2005) Insectes Sociaux, 52, pp. 327-332; DeHeer, C.J., A comparison of the colony-founding potential of queens from single- and multiple-queen colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta (2002) Animal Behaviour, 64, pp. 655-661; DeHeer, C.J., Herbers, J.M., Population genetics of the socially polymorphic ant Formica podzolica (2004) Insectes Sociaux, 51, pp. 309-316; DeHeer, C.J., Goodisman, M.A.D., Ross, K.G., Queen dispersal strategies in the multiple-queen form of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta (1999) American Naturalist, 153, pp. 660-675; Feldhaar, H., Fiala, B., Gadau, J., A shift in colony founding behaviour in the obligate plant-ant Crematogaster (Decacrema) morphospecies 2 (2005) Insectes Sociaux, 52, pp. 222-230; Fournier, D., Aron, S., Milinkovitch, M.C., Investigation of the population genetic structure and mating system in the ant Pheidole pallidula (2002) Molecular Ecology, 11, pp. 1805-1814; Fritz, G.N., Vander Meer, R.K., Sympatry of polygyne and monogyne colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (2003) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 96, pp. 86-92; Gyllenstrand, N., Seppä, P., Pamilo, P., Restricted gene flow between two social forms in the ant Formica truncorum (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 978-984; Hamilton, W.D., The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

Some theoretical models correlate mating success with male age, and predict female preference for either older males, as they have proven viability, or younger partners, to avoid age-related fitness costs. Differences in mating success of males in relation to age have been observed in Lepidoptera. We investigated the mating success of males in relation to their age, controlling for mating experience, and the fitness of their female mates in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. In a laboratory experiment we examined mating success in relation to age and the consequences of male age for female fitness parameters. Male age had no significant influence on mating success for O. nubilalis males: 0-day-old virgin males were as likely to mate as 3-, 6- and 9-day-old males. Testes size decreased and spermatophore size increased with virgin male age. Lifetime fecundity was highest for females that mated with 3-day-old virgin males, which was related to their greater longevity. There was no trade-off between daily fecundity and longevity for females mating with different-aged males. These results suggest that direct benefits from males are insufficient to account for the observed female mating preferences for different-aged males. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","European corn borer; fecundity; fitness; male spermatophore; mating behaviour; Ostrinia nubilalis; reproductive success; sexual selection","age class; fecundity; fitness; male behavior; mating success; moth; reproductive success; sexual selection; spermatophore; Crambidae; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Ostrinia nubilalis",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Andersson, M., Simmons, L.W., Sexual selection and mate choice (2006) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 296-302; Andow, D.A., Patterns of feeding and mortality of adult European corn borer (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in the laboratory (2001) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 94, pp. 563-565; Andow, D.A., Ancestral feeding and survival of offspring in European corn borer (2002) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 103, pp. 115-122; Andow, D.A., Stodola, T.J., (2003) European corn borer rearing manual, , http://www.entomology.umn.edu/ecb_manual/; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., The evolution of polyandry: multiple mating and female fitness in insects (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 145-164; Bissoondath, C., Wiklund, C., Protein content of spermatophores in relation to monandry/polyandry in butterflies (1995) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 37, pp. 365-371; Boggs, C.L., Gilbert, L.E., Male contribution to egg production in butterflies: evidence for transfer of nutrients at mating (1979) Science, 206, pp. 83-84; Brooks, R., Kemp, D.J., Can old males deliver the good genes?

We studied whether this apparently maladaptive behaviour could be compensated for by high accuracy of newly hatched larvae in locating host plants through either olfactory or visual cues. Olfaction capacity was quantified in a two-choice set-up (host plant versus control) in an olfactometer. Visual capacity was quantified in a small-scale open-air arena with a host plant and a dummy control placed randomly at the edge. We found no evidence that larvae oriented themselves towards the host plant in either of these experimental set-ups; instead, larvae moved in the direction of the sun, and arrested movement in the presence of a smell common to the control and treatment of the olfaction test. Because larvae do not locate their host plant at a distance, the probability of finding a host plant is likely to be critically dependent on host plant density. We tested this assumption by releasing larvae in open-air arenas with three different host plant densities. The probability of larvae reaching a host plant depended strongly on host plant density. A comparison with host plant densities observed in nature suggests that Apollo butterfly larvae require a relatively high host plant density in order to have a reasonable probability of locating a host plant before perishing. Our findings provide a clear proximate link between host plant density and larval mortality, a presumed key factor affecting population processes in the Apollo butterfly. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Apollo butterfly; host plant density; host plant location; initial survival; larva; olfaction; Parnassius apollo; random oviposition; visual signal","butterfly; host plant; mortality; olfactory cue; oviposition; population density; survival; visual cue; Fennoscandia; Papilionoidea; Parnassiinae; Parnassius apollo",,,,,,"Ascoli, A., Albert, P.J., Orientation behaviour of second-instar larvae of eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)

Nestlings may also assess danger independently, although there has been little investigation of this possibility. Additionally, nestlings might use parental signals to modify their response to possible cues of danger to reduce the likelihood of going silent to harmless stimuli. Nestling white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, cease calling in response to both parental alarms and the acoustic cues of a predator. However, it is unknown whether their response to the predator cue (a pied currawong, Strepera graculina, walking on leaf litter) is specific to the predator's sound, or whether it is a response to broadband, atonal sounds in general, to a 'walking tempo', or simply to any novel sound. Using field playback experiments of synthetic and natural sounds we show that nestlings are finely tuned to cues of danger. Nestlings suppressed calling most strongly to the sound of a real predator, and less strongly to broadband sounds. They did not respond to either novelty or a 'walking' tempo alone. Nestlings responded just as strongly to the predator's sound if they first heard the sound of a parent nearby, suggesting that they could discriminate predator cues from the sound of parental arrival, or that their interpretation of sounds was 'adaptively pessimistic'. Overall, scrubwren nestlings showed specific and independent assessment of predator sounds, which appeared unaffected by cues of parental presence. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic communication; acoustic structure; behavioural modification; nestling; novelty; predation; risk assessment; Sericornis frontalis; tempo; white-browed scrubwren","nestling; passerine; risk assessment; vocalization; vulnerability; Sericornis frontalis; Strepera graculina",,,,,,"Bell, M.B.V., Radford, A.N., Rose, R., Wade, H.M., Ridley, A.R., The value of constant surveillance in a risky environment (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 276, pp. 2997-3005; Bomford, M., O'Brien, P.H., Sonic deterrents in animal damage control: a review of device tests and effectiveness (1990) Wildlife Society Bulletin, 18, pp. 411-422; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Falling on deaf ears: the adaptive significance of begging in the absence of a parent (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 49, pp. 474-481; Burford, J.E., Friedrich, T.J., Yasukawa, K., Response to playback of nestling begging in the red-winged blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus (1998) Animal Behaviour, 56, pp. 555-561; Catania, K.C., Worm grunting, fiddling, and charming: humans unknowingly mimic a predator to harvest bait (2008) PLoS ONE, 3, pp. e3472; Charif, R.A., Waack, A.M., Strickman, L.M., (2008) Raven Pro 1.3 User's Manual, , Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York; Chivers, D.P., Wildy, E.L., Kiesecker, J.M., Blaustein, A.R., Avoidance response of juvenile pacific treefrogs to chemical cues of introduced predatory bullfrogs (2001) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 27, pp. 1667-1676; Clemmons, J.R., Vocalizations and other stimuli that elicit gaping in nestling black-capped chickadees (Parus atricapillus) (1995) Auk, 112, pp. 603-612; Curio, E., Ernst, U., Vieth, W., Cultural transmission of enemy recognition: one function of mobbing (1978) Science, 202, pp. 899-901; Darrow, P.A., Schivik, J.A., Bold, shy, and persistent: variable coyote response to light and sound stimuli (2009) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 116, pp. 82-87; Davies, N.B., Brooke, M.D., Cuckoos versus reed warblers: adaptations and counteradaptations (1988) Animal Behaviour, 36, pp. 262-284; Davies, N.B., Kilner, R.M., Noble, D.G., Nestling cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, exploit hosts with begging calls that mimic a brood (1998) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 265, pp. 673-678; Davies, N.B., Madden, J.R., Butchart, S.H.M., Learning fine-tunes a specific response of nestlings to the parental alarm calls of their own species (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 271, pp. 2297-2304; Davies, N.B., Madden, J.R., Butchart, S.H.M., Rutila, J., A host-race of the cuckoo Cuculus canorus with nestlings attuned to the parental alarm calls of the host species (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 693-699; Dawkins, R., Krebs, J.R., Arms races between and within species (1979) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 205, pp. 489-511; Fontaine, J.J., Martel, M., Markland, H.A., Niklison, A.A., Decker, K.L., Martin, T.E., Testing ecological and behavioral correlates of nest predation (2007) Oikos, 116, pp. 1887-1894; Godfray, H.C.J., Signalling of need by offspring to their parents (1991) Nature, 352, pp. 328-330; Godfray, H.C.J., Johnstone, R.A., Begging and bleating: the evolution of parent-offspring signalling (2000) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 355, pp. 1581-1591; Hemmi, J.M., Merkle, T., High stimulus specificity characterizes anti-predator habituation under natural conditions (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 276, pp. 4381-4388; Higgins, P.J., Peter, J.M., Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds (2002) Volume 6: Pardalotes to Shrike-thrushes, , Oxford University Press, South Melbourne; Khayutin, S.N., Sensory factors in the behavioral ontogeny of altricial birds (1985) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 15, pp. 105-152; Kilner, R.M., Hinde, C., Information warfare and parent-offspring conflict (2008) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 38, pp. 283-335; Kleindorfer, S., Hoi, H., Fessl, B., Alarm calls and chick reactions in the moustached warbler, Acrocephalus melanopogon (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 1199-1206; Krama, T., Krams, I., Cost of mobbing call to breeding pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca (2005) Behavioral Ecology, 16, pp. 37-40; Laurila, A., Pakkasmaa, S., Crochet, P.A., Merila, J., Predator-induced plasticity in early life history and morphology in two anuran amphibians (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 524-530; Leonard, M.L., Fernandez, N., Brown, G., Parental calls and nestling behavior in tree swallows (1997) Auk, 114, pp. 668-672; Leonard, M.L., Horn, A.G., Mukhida, A., False alarms and begging in nestling birds (2005) Animal Behaviour, 69, pp. 701-708; Lima, S.L., Nonlethal effects in the ecology of predator-prey interactions: what are the ecological effects of antipredator decision-making?

Males may coerce females to mate and aggression may inhibit female choice. The effect of male coercion on females has rarely been examined in primates. The present study focuses on male aggression towards females and the influence of male coercion on female choice in two communities of wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire to determine (1) whether male-to-female aggression increases in a sexual context, (2) the frequency, context and efficacy of male-female aggression and (3) the influence of male coercion on female choice. Our results suggest that direct male coercion was relatively rare, was used by less preferred males, and did not seem to function effectively to constrain female mate preferences as neither (1) a general measure of overall male-female aggression nor (2) a specific measure of direct sexual coercion corresponded to male mating success, and (3) male aggression did not correspond to increased female proceptivity or decreased female resistance rates. Lastly, variation in male-female sexual strategies appears to be yet another important realm for behavioural diversity in chimpanzees. This detailed examination of chimpanzee male-to-female aggression emphasizes the importance of carefully distinguishing male and female influences on sexual interactions in light of their disparate reproductive interests. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chimpanzee; female mate preference; male aggression; Pan troglodytes; sexual coercion; sexual conflict","aggression; behavioral ecology; mate choice; national park; primate; sexual conflict; Cote d'Ivoire; Tai National Park; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Pan troglodytes verus; Primates",,,,,,"Altmann, S.A., Baboons: space, time, and energy (1974) American Zoologist, 14, pp. 221-248; Andersson, M., Iwasa, Y., Sexual selection (1996) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 11, pp. 53-58; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict: Monographs in Behaviour and Ecology, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bercovitch, F.B., Time budgets and consortships in olive baboons (Papio anubis) (1983) Folia Primatologica, 41, pp. 180-190; Boesch, C., Boesch-Achermann, H., (2000) The Chimpanzees of the Taï Forest, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Boesch, C., (2009) The Real Chimpanzee: Sex Strategies in the Forest, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Boesch, C., Kohou, G., Néné, H., Vigilant, L., Male competition and paternity in wild chimpanzees of the Taï forest (2006) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 130, pp. 103-115; Bygott, J.D., Agonistic behaviour, dominance, and social structure of wild chimpanzees of the Gombe National Park (1979) The Great Apes, pp. 405-428. , Hamburg D.A., and Mccown E.R.

How to facilitate the spread of useful resources but restrict harmful substances? This dilemma reaches a zenith in famine relief. Survival depends on distributing food fast but that could increase vulnerability to poisons. We tested how Temnothorax albipennis ants solve this dilemma in the distribution of honey solution after 48 h of starvation in four colonies with individually marked workers. We constructed the complete network of liquid food transmission (trophallaxis) between individuals. Within the first 30 min of famine relief, 95% of the workers received food and the distribution rate was an order of magnitude faster compared to the controls. We tested the assumptions of a simple analytical model that best fitted our data. Good mixing during famine relief was facilitated by the movement of internal workers away from the brood pile and the movement of foragers with food away from the nest entrance. This is intriguing because T. albipennis workers have spatial fidelity zones and in the controls internal and external workers were segregated. We discovered that colony vulnerability to poisons during famine relief might be mitigated by: (1) the dilution of food from the same source through mixing, (2) the concentration of food in workers positioned midway between the colony centre and its periphery and (3) the existence of living 'silos'. The latter are expendable foragers, who stay inside the nest and store food during famine relief, thus acting as potential disposable testers for food toxicity. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","ant; distribution; emergency; food; network; social; spatial; starvation; Temnothorax albipennis; trophallaxis","ant; famine; social behavior; social organization; starvation; vulnerability; zenith angle; Formicidae; Leptothorax albipennis",,,,,,"Backen, S.J., Sendova-Franks, A.B., Franks, N.R., Testing the limits of social resilience in ant colonies (2000) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 48, pp. 125-131; Beattie, A.J., (1985) The Evolutionary Ecology of Ant-Plant Mutualisms, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Blanchard, G.B., Orledge, G.M., Reynolds, S.E., Franks, N.R., Division of labour and seasonality in the ant Leptothorax albipennis: worker corpulence and its influence on behaviour (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 723-738; Børgesen, L.W., Nutritional function of replete workers in the pharaoh's ant, Monomorium pharaonis (L.)

In this study we used laboratory colonies of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to quantify how ants regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake when restricted to diets with different fixed protein-carbohydrate (p:c) ratios, and to quantify, at both the individual and colony level, behaviours and costs associated with nutrient regulation when feeding on these foods. We found that ants were most attracted to foods with equal or moderately protein-biased p:c ratios. However, colonies on these two treatments created large hoards, and the p:c ratios of these foods differed from that of collected food. In general, carbohydrates were extracted and protein was retained. As a result, carbohydrate intake on all diets except the extremely protein-biased diet was similar. However, carbohydrate regulation on diets with equal and moderately protein-biased p:c ratios may be costly through elevated worker activity and mortality, and through reduction of worker lipid reserves. For colonies feeding on heavily protein-biased food, energy production may have been achieved via gluconeogenesis. We discuss our results in relation to how dietary p:c imbalances in naturally encountered foods may be driving ant foraging behaviour in the field. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","carbohydrate; fire ant; foraging behaviour; geometric framework; gluconeogenesis; lipid; Solenopsis invicta","ant; caching; carbohydrate; colony structure; diet; food availability; foraging behavior; lipid; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Solenopsis geminata; Solenopsis invicta",,,,,,"Ayre, G.L., The relationships between food and digestive enzymes in five species of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (1967) Canadian Entomologist, 99, pp. 408-411; Banks, W.A., Lofgren, C.S., Jouvenaz, D.P., Stringer, C.E., Bishop, P.M., Williams, D.F., Wojcik, D.P., Glancey, B.M., (1981) Techniques for Collecting, Rearing and Handling Imported Fire Ants, , U.S. Department of Agriculture-ARS-SEA, New Orleans; Beauchamp, G., Effects of energy requirements and worker mortality on colony growth and foraging in the honey bee (1992) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 31, pp. 123-132; Behmer, S.T., Insect herbivore nutrient regulation (2009) Annual Review of Entomology, 54, pp. 165-187; Berner, D., Blanckenhorn, W.U., Körner, C., Grasshoppers cope with low host plant quality by compensatory feeding and food selection: N limitation challenged (2005) Oikos, 111, pp. 525-533; Beshers, S.N., Fewell, J.H., Models of division of labor in social insects (2001) Annual Review of Entomology, 46, pp. 413-440; Blanchard, G.B., Orledge, G.M., Reynolds, S.E., Franks, N.R., Division of labour and seasonality in the ant Leptothorax albipennis: worker corpulence and its influence on behaviour (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 723-738; Boersma, M., Elser, J.J., Too much of a good thing: on stoiciometrically balanced diets and maximal growth (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 1325-1330; Cannon, C.A., Fell, R.D., Patterns of macronutrient collection in the black carpenter ant, Camponotus pennsylvanicus (De Geer) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (2002) Environmental Entomology, 31, pp. 977-981; Cassill, D., Yoyo bang: a risk-aversion investment strategy by a perennial insect society (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 150-158; Cassill, D., Rules of supply and demand regulate recruitment to food in an ant society (2003) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54, pp. 441-450; Cassill, D.L., Tschinkel, W.R., Information flow during social feeding in ant societies (1999) Information Processing in Social Insects, pp. 69-81. , Detrain C., Deneubourg J.L., and Pasteels J.M.

The effects of the larva are apparently due to a chemical product or products that it introduces into the spider. Behavioural modification is gradual, and various behavioural effects arise in a consistent order. If the wasp larva is experimentally removed just before it kills the spider, the spider's behaviour recovers gradually in the reverse order. In addition, a greater delay in removing the larva leads to more pronounced and enduring behavioural changes, so the larval effects may depend on a cumulative or dose-dependent process. Changes in numbers and lengths of radii and numbers of sticky spiral loops could result from correlated larval effects on the reduction in the amount of silk in the spider's sticky spiral silk glands (or a signal thereof), but several other types of behavioural change are probably under separate controls; multiple larval products may be involved. The larvae may affect higher levels of behavioural decisions by spiders that determine overall web 'design', rather than lower levels, such as control of particular behaviour patterns, as may be affected by related wasps. The larva's effects are fine-tuned to details of the host's natural history.","Allocyclosa bifurca; orb web; parasitic manipulation of host; parasitoid wasp; Polysphincta clade; Polysphincta gutfreundi","behavioral response; cocoon; correlation; larva; parasitoid; spider; wasp; Araneae; Vespoidea",,,,,,"Barron, A.B., Maleska, R., Vander Meer, R.K., Robinson, G.E., Octopamine modulates honey bee dance behavior (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., 104, pp. 1703-1707; Biron, D.G., Marché, L., Ponton, F., Loxdale, G.D., Galéotti, N., Renault, L., Joly, C., Thomas, F., Behavioural manipulation in a grasshopper harbouring hairworm: a proteomics approach (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 272, pp. 2117-2126; Biron, D.G., Ponton, F., Marché, L., Galéotti, N., Renault, L., Demey-Thomas, E., Poncet, J., Thomas, F., 'Suicide' of crickets harboring hairworms: a proteomics investigation (2006) Insect Molecular Biology, 15, pp. 731-742; Eberhard, W.G., Behavioral characters for the higher classification of orb-weaving spiders (1982) Evolution, 36, pp. 1067-1095; Eberhard, W.G., Behavioral flexibility in orb web construction: effects of silk supply in different glands (1988) Journal of Arachnology, 16, pp. 303-320; Eberhard, W.G., Early stages of orb construction by Philoponella, Leucauge, and Nephila spiders (Araneae: Uloboridae and Araneidae) (1990) Journal of Arachnology, 18, pp. 205-234; Eberhard, W.G., Spider manipulation by a wasp larva (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 255-256; Eberhard, W.G., The natural history and behavior of Hymenopimecis argyraphaga (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) a parasitoid of Plesiometa argyra (Araneae: Tetragnathidae) (2000) Journal of Hymenoptera Research, 9, pp. 220-240; Eberhard, W.G., Under the influence: webs and building behavior of Plesiometa argyra (Araneae: Tetragnathidae) when parasitized by Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) (2001) Journal of Arachnology, 29, pp. 354-366; Eberhard, W.G., Substitution of silk stabilimenta for egg sacs by Allocyclosa bifurca (Araneae: Araneidae) suggests that silk stabilimenta function as camouflage devices (2003) Behaviour, 140, pp. 847-868; Foelix, R., (1996) The Biology of Spiders, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Gal, R., Rosenberg, L.A., Libersat, F., Parasitoid wasp uses a venom cocktail injected into the brain to manipulate behavior and metabolism of its cockroach prey (2005) Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, 60, pp. 198-208; Gauld, I.D., Dubois, J., Phylogeny of the Polysphincta group of genera (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae: Pimplinae): a taxonomic revision of spider ectoparasitoids (2006) Systematic Entomology, 31, pp. 529-564; Gonzaga, M.O., Sobczak, J.F., Parasitoid-induced mortality of Araneus omnicolor (Araneae, Araneidae) by Hymenoepimecis sp.

We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","complex system; graph; grazing behaviour; Ovis aries; sheep; synchronization","body size; grazing; intraspecific interaction; multivariate analysis; sampling; sheep; software; time series; Animalia; Ovis aries",,,,,,"Albert, R., Barabasi, A.-L., Statistical mechanics of complex networks (2002) Reviews of Modern Physics, 74, pp. 47-97; Altmann, J., Observational study of behaviour: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Boccaletti, S., Latora, V., Moreno, Y., Chavez, M., Hwang, D.-U., Complex networks: structure and dynamics (2006) Physics Reports, 424, pp. 175-308; Bolliet, V., Lambert, P., Rives, J., Bardonnet, A., Rhythmic swimming activity in Anguilla anguilla glass eels: synchronisation to water current reversal under laboratory conditions (2007) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 344, pp. 54-66; Bollobás, B., (2008) Modern Graph Theory, , Springer, New York; Bon, R., Deneubourg, J.-L., Gerard, J.-F., Michelena, P., Sexual segregation in ungulates: from individual mechanisms to collective patterns (2005) Sexual Segregation in Vertebrates: Ecology of the Two Sexes, pp. 200-217. , Ruckstuhl K.E., and Neuhaus P.

In particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank, which partially determines mating success in this species. The expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or genetic basis. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; behavioural syndrome; bluefin killifish; dominance hierarchy; Lucania goodei; personality; repeatability; sexual selection; social interactions","aggression; behavioral ecology; courtship; cyprinid; dominance; freshwater ecosystem; male behavior; sexual selection; social organization; Animalia; Cyprinodontiformes; Lucania goodei",,,,,,"Appleby, M.C., The probability of linearity in hierarchies (1983) Animal Behaviour, 31, pp. 600-608; Arnold, K.E., Ramsay, S.L., Donaldson, C., Adam, A., Parental prey selection affects risk-taking behaviour and spatial learning in avian offspring (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 2563-2569; Becker, W.A., (1992) Manual of Quantitative Genetics. 5th edn, , Academic Enterprises, Pullman, Washington; Bell, A.M., Behavioural differences between individuals and two populations of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 464-473; Bell, A.M., Sih, A., Exposure to predation generates personality in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 828-834; Bell, A.M., Hankison, S.J., Laskowski, K.L., The repeatability of behaviour: a meta-analysis (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 771-783; Biro, P.A., Dingemanse, N.J., Sampling bias resulting from animal personality (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 66-67; Boake, C.R.B., Repeatability: its role in evolutionary studies of mating behavior (1989) Evolutionary Ecology, 3, pp. 173-182; Bolhuis, J.E., Schouten, W.G.P., de Leeuw, J.A., Schrama, J.W., Wiegant, V.M., Individual coping characteristics, rearing conditions and behavioural flexibility in pigs (2004) Behavioural Brain Research, 152, pp. 351-360; Boon, A.K., Réale, D., Boutin, S., The interaction between personality, offspring fitness and food abundance in North American red squirrels (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 1094-1104; Both, C., Dingemanse, N.J., Drent, P.J., Tinbergen, J.M., Pairs of extreme avian personalities have highest reproductive success (2005) Journal of Animal Ecology, 74, pp. 667-674; Calsbeek, R., Sinervo, B., The ontogeny of territoriality during maturation (2002) Oecologia, 132, pp. 468-477; Careau, V., Thomas, D., Humphries, M.M., Réale, D., Energy metabolism and animal personality (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 641-653; Clark, A.B., Ehlinger, T.J., Pattern and adaptation in individual behavioral differences (1987) Perspectives in Ethology.

High densities of workers in ant colonies impose traffic congestion costs on foraging trails. It has been postulated that crowding also increases foraging efficiency by facilitating information transfer between workers in head-on encounters. However, this hypothesis remains untested. Here we assessed, in 24 field nests of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes, whether head-on encounters between workers facilitate information transfer about trail condition, orientation and food. Several experimental manipulations failed to fit predictions of certain types of communication. (1) Trail disturbance (and thus potential need for information transfer) did not affect the rate of head-on encounters, (2) head-on encounters did not decrease the time required for laden ants to properly orient when entering a trail, and (3) ants that had been experimentally disoriented did not increase the number of head-on encounters when they returned to the trail. Nevertheless, one experiment strongly suggested information acquisition: (4) outbound ants were more likely to find and collect food after a head-on encounter with an ant carrying the same kind of food. These results do not support the hypotheses that workers exchange information about trail condition and orientation in head-on encounters, but suggest that workers acquire food information. The information transferred in head-on encounters could thus increase foraging efficiency under crowded conditions. The cost of the reduced speed due to worker collisions might be outweighed by the benefits of information acquisition, and could explain why leaf-cutting ants do not form distinct lanes of outbound and returning workers. Our results reinforce the key role of information use in the adaptive behaviour of animals and in the maintenance of group living. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","ant foraging; Atta cephalotes; leaf-cutting ant; recruitment; trail traffic","ant; behavioral response; foraging behavior; population density; recruitment (population dynamics); Animalia; Atta; Atta cephalotes; Formicidae",,,,,,"Anderson, C., Jadin, J., The adaptive benefit of leaf transfer in Atta colombica (2001) Insectes Sociaux, 48, pp. 291-301; Barta, Z., Giraldeau, L.-A., Breeding colonies as information centers: a reappraisal of information-based hypothesis using the producer-scrounger game (2001) Behavioral Ecology, 12, pp. 121-127; Bonabeau, E., Theraulaz, G., Deneubourg, J.-L., Aron, S., Camazine, S., Self-organization in social insects (1997) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 12, pp. 188-193; Brown, C., Cliff swallow colonies as information centers (1987) Science, 234, pp. 83-85; Burd, M., Ecological consequences of traffic organization in ant societies (1996) Physica A, 372, pp. 124-131; Burd, M., Aranwela, N., Head-on encounter rates and walking speed of foragers in leaf-cutting ant traffic (2003) Insectes Sociaux, 50, pp. 3-8; Burd, M., Archer, D., Aranwela, N., Tradling, D., Traffic dynamics of the leaf-cutting ant, Atta cephalotes (2002) American Naturalist, 159, pp. 283-293; Chauvin, C., Thierry, B., Tonkean macaques orient their food search from olfactory cues conveyed by conspecifics (2005) Ethology, 111, pp. 301-310; Couzin, L.D., Franks, N.R., Self-organized lane formation and optimized traffic flow in army ants (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 270, pp. 139-146; Dall, S., Giraldeau, L.-A., Olsson, O., McNamara, J., Stephens, D., Information and its use by animals in evolutionary ecology (2005) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20, pp. 187-192; Dukas, E., (1998) Cognitive Ecology: the Evolutionary Ecology of Information Processing and Decision Making, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Dornhaus, A., Chittka, L., Food alert in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris): possible mechanisms and evolutionary implications (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 50, pp. 570-576; Dornhaus, A., Chittka, L., Information flow and foraging decisions in bumblebees (Bombus spp.) (2004) Apidologie, 31, pp. 93-113; Dussutour, A., Fourcassié, V., Helbing, D., Deneubourg, J.-L., Optimal traffic organization in ants under crowded conditions (2004) Nature, 428, pp. 70-73; Dussutour, A., Deneubourg, J.-L., Fourcassié, V., Temporal organization of bi-directional traffic in the ant Lasius niger (L.)

Detecting these cues is often complicated by benign stimuli that resemble and can be mistaken for predators, leading prey to display costly defences incorrectly. One strategy that prey have evolved to reduce these 'false alarms' is to respond only to stimuli with characteristics consistent with predator cues. Decision errors might still be frequent, however, in cases where the probability distributions of benign stimulus properties completely overlap those of predator cues. In such cases, inhibition of defensive responses by characteristic features of benign stimuli could further improve discrimination. Red-eyed treefrog embryos, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch prematurely to escape egg predators. They detect predators using vibrations generated during attacks. However, common benign disturbances such as rainstorms generate vibrations with property probability distributions that largely overlap those of predators. We used vibration playbacks to test the hypotheses that embryos use two features of rainstorm vibrations not shared by predator attacks, characteristic high frequencies and an initial period of intensity buildup, to avoid hatching in response to this benign stimulus. The escape-hatching response to otherwise stimulatory vibrations is reduced in the presence of either feature characteristic of rainstorms. Either A. callidryas embryos use rainstorm features to inform their hatching decision or these features alter their perception of predator cues. Identifying likely sources of potential false alarms and comparing their stimulus characteristics to predator cues and prey decision rules will improve our understanding of both the information processing challenges facing prey and the ways they solve them. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Agalychnis callidryas; anura; decision rule; detection theory; discrimination; information; phenotypic plasticity; predator detection; predator-prey interaction; red-eyed treefrog","decision making; defense behavior; frog; hatching; hypothesis testing; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; risk assessment; Agalychnis callidryas; Anura",,,,,,"Bacher, S., Casas, J., Dorn, S., Parasitoid vibrations as potential releasing stimulus of evasive behaviour in a leafminer (1996) Physiological Entomology, 21, pp. 33-43; Barth, F.G., Bleckmann, H., Bohnenberger, J., Seyfarth, E.-A., Spiders of the genus Cupiennius Simon 1891 (Araneae, Ctenidae).

We attached activity meters and GPS recorders to 21 neighbouring lizards in a semiarid site in South Australia, and monitored their location every 10 min over 3 months (September-December 2007). From over 5000 sets of synchronized location records we calculated distances between all possible dyads of active lizards, and constructed binary social networks based on close associations between individuals. We compared empirical networks with a null model network for spatially structured populations that assumed random movement within lizard home ranges. We showed significantly lower network degree (i.e. fewer cases of individuals associating) in the observed network than in the null model, and deduced avoidance between some individuals. We found the predominant form of social organization was pair living, and, contrary to previous reports, we found pair associations persisted after mating had finished. Thus, the network analysis revealed a cryptic social organization, which cannot be explained by either biparental care or mate guarding, but may instead relate to refuge site distributions, enhanced vigilance or efficient location of mates in subsequent seasons. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","association; network; pair living; sleepy lizard; social organization; Tiliqua rugosa","activity pattern; GPS; home range; lizard; movement; pair bond; refuge; semiarid region; social organization; vigilance; Australia; South Australia; Squamata; Trachydosaurus rugosus",,,,,,"Auburn, Z.M., Bull, C.M., Kerr, G.D., The visual perceptual range of a lizard, Tiliqua rugosa (2009) Journal of Ethology, 27, pp. 75-81; Barrett, L., Lowen, C.B., Random walks and the gas model: spacing behaviour of grey-cheeked mangabeys (1998) Functional Ecology, 12, pp. 857-865; Bejder, L., Fletcher, D., Bräger, S., A method for testing association patterns of social animals (1998) Animal Behaviour, 56, pp. 719-725; Black, J.M., Introduction: pair bonds and partnerships (1996) Partnerships in Birds: the Study of Monogamy, pp. 3-20. , Black J.M.

Consistent with this proposal, we found that men had stronger preferences than women for women's voices with raised pitch (i.e. feminized female voices) and that women had stronger preferences than men for men's voices with lowered pitch (i.e. masculinized male voices). Importantly, however, no such opposite-sex bias was evident for attributions of dominance to voices with raised and lowered pitch; men's and women's voices with lowered pitch were perceived to be more dominant than those with raised pitch and these effects were equivalent for male and female listeners. Collectively, our findings suggest that preferences for voice pitch may function, at least in part, to identify high-quality mates and show that opposite-sex biases in preferences for voice pitch cannot be explained simply by greater general sensitivity to manipulated pitch in opposite-sex voices than in own-sex voices. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","attraction; fundamental frequency; mate choice; mate preference; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; vocal cue","auditory cue; bioacoustics; human behavior; mate choice; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; vocalization; womens status",,,,,,"Apicella, C.L., Feinberg, D.R., Marlowe, F.W., Voice pitch predicts reproductive success in male hunter-gatherers (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 682-684; Beani, L., Dessi-Fulgheri, F., Mate choice in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix: role of physical and behavioural male traits (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 347-356; Boersma, P., Weenink, D., (2007) Praat, , http://www.praat.org, Summer Institute of Linguistics, Dallas, Texas; Bryant, A.B., Haselton, M.G., Vocal cues of ovulation in human females (2009) Biology Letters, 5, pp. 12-15; Collins, S., Men's voices and women's choices (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 773-780; Collins, S., Missing, C., Vocal and visual attractiveness are related in women (2003) Animal Behaviour, 6, pp. 997-1004; Darwin, C., (1871) The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, , D.

In this study, we used three hosts of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, that varied in size (i.e. smaller, similar to and larger than cowbirds of a given age) to determine whether parasitic nestlings altered patterns of food provisioning by host parents and begging by host young under field conditions. Adult provisioning did not change in the presence of a cowbird but instead was influenced by feeding treatment and host size. In parasitized broods where nestlings differed in size (i.e. the small and large hosts), the larger nestling received the majority of food brought to the nest, regardless of whether it was the cowbird or host nestling. In contrast, similar-sized host nestlings received a similar amount of food in parasitized and unparasitized host broods. Relative to unparasitized broods, the presence of a cowbird led to increased begging intensity by the small host, had no clear effect on begging behaviour of the intermediate-sized host, and reduced begging intensity of the large host. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a cowbird did not lead to changes in provisioning behaviour in parents, and the extent to which cowbirds influenced host begging behaviour depended on the size of the host. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","begging; brood parasitism; brown-headed cowbird; host-parasite interaction; Molothrus ater; offspring solicitation; parent feeding; provisioning behaviour","begging behavior; brood parasitism; fitness; food provisioning; host-parasite interaction; nestling; passerine; Aves; Molothrus; Molothrus ater",,,,,,"Bengtsson, H., Ryden, O., Parental feeding rate in relation to begging behavior in asynchronously hatched broods of the great tit Parus major (1983) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 12, pp. 243-251; Briskie, J.V., Sealy, S.G., Evolution of short incubation periods in the parasitic cowbirds, Molothrus spp (1990) Auk, 107, pp. 789-794; Budden, A.E., Wright, J., Begging in nestling birds (2001) Current Ornithology, 16, pp. 83-118; Carey, M., Burhans, D.E., Nelson, D.A., Field sparrow (Spizella pusilla (1994) The Birds of North America.

However, integration of body size and temperature effects is rarely approached in the study of antipredator behaviour in vertebrate ectotherms. In the present study we investigated whether temperature affects antipredator responses of tegu lizards, Tupinambis merianae, with distinct body sizes, testing the hypothesis that small tegus (juveniles) run away from predators regardless of the environmental temperature, because defensive aggression may not be an effective predator deterrent, whereas adults, which are larger, use aggressive defence at low temperatures, when running performance might be suboptimal. We recorded responses of juvenile (= small) and adult (= large) tegu lizards to a simulated predatory attack at five environmental temperatures in the laboratory. Most differences between the two size classes were observed at low temperatures: large tegus were more aggressive overall than were small tegus at all temperatures tested, but at lower temperatures, the small lizards often used escape responses whereas the large ones either adopted a defensive posture or remained inactive. These results provide strong evidence that body size and temperature affect the antipredator responses of vertebrate ectotherms. We discuss the complex and intricate network of evolutionary and ecological parameters that are likely to be involved in the evolution of such interactions. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggressive response; antipredator behaviour; body size; escape response; tegu lizard; temperature; Tupinambis merianae","antipredator defense; behavioral response; body size; body temperature; ectothermy; escape behavior; evolutionary biology; fighting; flight; fly; lizard; temperature effect; Animalia; Squamata; Tupinambis merianae; Tupinambis nigropunctatus; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Abe, A.S., Estivation in South American amphibians and reptiles (1995) Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, 28, pp. 1241-1247; Anderson, R.A., McBrayer, L.D., Herrel, A., Bite force in vertebrates: opportunities and caveats for use of a nonpareil whole-animal performance measure (2008) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 93, pp. 709-720. , 10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00905.x; Andrade, D.V., Abe, A.S., Gas exchange and ventilation during dormancy in the tegu lizard Tupinambis merianae (1999) Journal of Experimental Biology, 202, pp. 3677-3685; Andrade, D.V., Brito, S.P., Toledo, L.F.R., Abe, A.S., Seasonal changes in blood oxygen transport and acid-base status in the tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae (2004) Respiratory Physiology & Neurobiology, 140, pp. 197-208; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Niewiarowski, P.H., Navas, C.A., The evolution of thermal physiology in ectoterms (2002) Journal of Thermal Biology, 27, pp. 249-268. , 10.1016/S0306-4565(01)00094-8; Arendt, J.D., Influence of sprint speed and body size on predator avoidance in New Mexican spadefoot toads (Spea multiplicata) (2009) Oecologia, 159, pp. 455-461. , 10.1007/s00442-008-1210-z; Avila-Pires, T.C., (1995) Lizards of Brazilian Amazonia (Reptilia:Squamata), , Zoologische Verhandelingen, Leiden; Bennett, A.F., The thermal dependence of lizard behaviour (1980) Animal Behaviour, 28, pp. 752-762; Bianchi, R.C., Mendes, S.L., Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) predation on primates in Caratinga Biological Station, Southeast Brazil (2007) American Journal of Primatology, 69, pp. 1173-1178. , 10.1002/ajp.20415; Bulova, S.J., Ecological correlates of population and individual variation in antipredador behaviour of two species of desert lizards (1994) Copeia, 1994, pp. 980-992; Cooper Jr., W.E., Escape behaviour by prey blocked from entering the nearest refuge (1999) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 77, pp. 671-674. , 10.1139/cjz-77-4-671; Cooper Jr., W.E., Effect of temperature on escape behaviour by an ectothermic vertebrate, the keeled earless lizard (Holbrookia propinqua) (2000) Behaviour, 137, pp. 1299-1315. , 10.1163/156853900501935; Eklöv, P., Werner, E.E., Multiple predator effects on size-dependent behaviour and mortality of two species of anuran larvae (2000) Oikos, 88, pp. 250-258. , 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880203.x; Garland Jr., T., Losos, J.B., Ecological morphology of locomotor performance in squamate reptiles (1994) Ecological Morphology: Integrative Organismal Biology, pp. 240-302. , Wainwright P.C., and Reilly S.M.

We examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general, and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope with environmental variability. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","antlion; foraging; hunger; Myrmeleon hyalinus; Myrmeleontidae; response time; sit-and-wait predator","adaptation; behavioral response; environmental change; insect; larva; prey availability; prey capture; prey selection; prey size; Hexapoda; Myrmeleon; Myrmeleontidae",,,,,,"Bell, W.J., Searching behavior patterns in insects (1990) Annual Review of Entomology, 35, pp. 447-467; Dall, S.R.X., Giraldeau, L.-A., Olsson, O., McNamara, J.M., Stephens, D.W., Information and its use by animals in evolutionary ecology (2005) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 20, pp. 187-193; Devetak, D., Detection of substrate vibration in Neuropteriodea: a review (1998) Acta Zoologica Fennica, 209, pp. 87-94; Diaz-Fleischer, F., Predatory behaviour and prey-capture decision-making by the web weaving spider Micrathena sagittata (2005) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 83, pp. 268-273; Eltz, T., Foraging in the ant-lion Myrmeleon mobilis Hagen 1888 (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae): behavioral flexibility of a sit-and-wait predator (1997) Journal of Insect Behavior, 10, pp. 1-11; Ferran, A., Dixon, A.F.G., Foraging behaviour of the ladybird larvae (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (1993) European Journal of Entomology, 90, pp. 383-402; Griffiths, D., The feeding biology of ant-lion larvae: prey capture, handling and utilization (1980) Journal of Animal Ecology, 49, pp. 99-125; Guillette, L.M., Hollis, K.L., Markarian, A., Learning in a sedentary insect predator: antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) anticipate a long wait (2009) Behavioral Processes, 80, pp. 224-232; Heinrich, B., Heinrich, M.J.E., The pit-trapping foraging strategy of the ant lion, Myrmeleon immaculatus DeGeer (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) (1984) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 14, pp. 151-160; Herberstein, M.E., Craig, C.L., Elgar, M.A., Foraging strategies and feeding regimes: web and decoration investment in Argiope keyserlingi Karsch (Araneae: Araneidae) (2000) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 2, pp. 69-80; Iwasa, Y., Higashi, M., Prey distribution as a factor determining the choice of optimal foraging strategy (1981) American Naturalist, 117, pp. 710-723; Jenkins, B.A., The behavioral response of the antlion Myrmeleon pictifrons to a sudden change in prey capture rate (1994) Acta Oecologica, 2, pp. 231-240; Krink, T., Vollrath, F., Analysing spider web-building behaviour with rule-based simulations and genetic algorithms (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 185, pp. 321-331; Li, D.Q., Lee, W.S., Predator induced plasticity in web-building behavior (2004) Animal Behaviour, 67, pp. 309-318; Lima, S.L., Nonlethal effects in the ecology of predator-prey interactions (1998) BioScience, 48, pp. 25-34; Lomascolo, S., Farji-Brener, A.G., Adaptive short-term changes in pit design by antlion larvae (Myrmeleon sp.) in response to different prey conditions (2001) Ethology, Ecology & Evolution, 13, pp. 393-397; Loria, R., Scharf, I., Subach, A., Ovadia, O., The interplay between foraging mode, habitat structure, and predator presence in antlions (2008) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 62, pp. 1185-1192; Lucas, J.R., Metabolic rates and pit-construction costs of two antlion species (1985) Journal of Arid Environments, 54, pp. 295-309; Morse, D.H., The effect of experience on the hunting success of newly emerged spiderlings (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 827-835; Nakamuta, K., Mechanism of the switchover from extensive to area-concentrated search behaviour of the ladybird beetle, Coccinella septempunctata bruckii (1985) Journal of Insect Physiology, 31, pp. 849-856; Nakata, K., Prey detection without successful capture affects spider's orb-web building behaviour (2007) Naturwissenschaften, 94, pp. 853-857; Nams, V.O., Density-dependent predation by skunks using olfactory search images (1997) Oecologia, 110, pp. 440-448; Napolitano, J.F., Predatory behavior of a pit-making antlion, Myrmeleon mobilis (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) (1998) Florida Entomologist, 81, pp. 562-566; Olive, C.W., Behavioral response of a sit-and-wait predator to spatial variation in foraging gain (1982) Ecology, 63, pp. 912-920; Persons, M., Hunger effects on foraging responses to perceptual cues in immature and adult wolf spiders (Lycosidae) (1999) Animal Behaviour, 57, pp. 81-88; Punzo, F., (2000) Desert Arthropods: Life History Variations, , Springer, Berlin; Riechert, S.E., Luczak, J., Spider foraging: behavioral responses to prey (1982) Spider Communication: Mechanisms and Ecological Significance, pp. 353-385. , Witt P.N., and Rovner J.S.

We investigated experimentally how stimulus/local enhancement, a form of indirect social influence through the physical traces typically left in the environment by previous stone handlers, might trigger SH behaviour at the individual level, and thus could contribute to the maintenance of the SH tradition at the group level. Through the semicontrolled conditions of field experiments, conducted in the free-ranging provisioned Arashiyama E troop, in which the SH tradition has been well established for nearly three decades, our results supported the stimulus/local enhancement hypothesis. Most group members preferentially directed their SH behaviour towards typical physical traces of SH activity (piles of stones) over randomly scattered stones. Encountering SH artefacts enhanced the use of these particular stones for performing SH in that particular part of the environment. The common occurrence of such 'play stations' may favour the frequent reuse of the same stones over time and explain the transport of stones between and around SH artefacts. We provided evidence for the role of indirect social inputs on the long-term persistence of the SH tradition in Japanese macaques, through SH by-products, the stimulating effect of which can be delayed in time and separate in space from others. We discuss our findings from the perspective of socially mediated behaviours, conformity-enforcing responses and niche construction. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","artefact; cultural maintenance; field experiment; indirect social influence; Japanese macaque; Macaca fuscata; niche construction; stimulus/local enhancement; stone handling; traditional behaviour","behavioral ecology; group behavior; hypothesis testing; life history trait; primate; Macaca; Macaca fuscata",,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Byrne, R.W., Russon, A.E., Learning by imitation: a hierarchical approach (1998) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp. 667-721; Caldwell, C.A., Whiten, A., Social learning in monkeys and apes: cultural animals?

Box 0943-03092, Balboa Ancón, Panama","Signalling is a dynamic process that often occurs over brief timescales, particularly in the acoustic modality. Numerous studies of mate choice and acoustic communication have identified signal parameters essential for species recognition and mate preferences, although these studies have rarely considered the dynamic nature of these processes. Here we investigate mate choice behaviour in female túngara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, in response to temporally dynamic presentations of male advertisement calls. Our results demonstrate that females are sensitive to the location of preferred call types on a moment-to-moment basis, and that responses are influenced by the continued presence, complexity, sound pressure level and inherent attractiveness of individual male signals. In general, our results support the notion that decision making during mate choice is an open-ended process that is sensitive to interruption and persuasion from competing signallers. We show that for a species in which females actively compare multiple signallers simultaneously, the criterion that predicts the degree of commitment to an initial mate approach is whether there is a state change in the complexity of signals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","acoustic communication; decision-making process; mate choice; phonotaxis; Physalaemus pustulosus; temporal updating; túngara frog","bioacoustics; calling behavior; decision making; female behavior; frog; mate choice; phototaxis; signaling; Anura; Physalaemus pustulosus",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Bateson, P., (1983) Mate Choice, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bernal, X.E., Akre, K.L., Baugh, A.T., Rand, A.S., Ryan, M.J., Female and male behavioral response to advertisement calls of graded complexity in túngara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus (2009) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 63, pp. 1269-1279; Blaisdell, A.P., Denniston, J.C., Miller, R.R., Posttraining shifts in the overshadowing stimulus-unconditioned stimulus interval alleviates the overshadowing deficit (1999) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 25, pp. 18-27; Boyd, S.K., Arginine vasotocin facilitation of advertisement calling and call phonotaxis in bullfrogs (1994) Hormones and Behavior, 28, pp. 232-240; Chu, J., Marler, C.A., Wilczynski, W., The effects of arginine vasotocin on the calling behavior of male cricket frogs in changing social contexts (1998) Hormones and Behavior, 34, pp. 248-261; Darwin, C., (1871) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, , J. Murray, London; Isolating mechanisms (1951) Genetics and the Origin of Species, pp. 179-211. , Dobzhansky, T, Ed, New York: Columbia University Press; Dyson, M.L., Henzi, P., Passmore, N.I., The effect of changes in the relative timing of signals during female phonotaxis in the reed frog, Hyperolius marmoratus (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 679-685; Gerhardt, H.C., Dyson, M.L., Tanner, S.D., Dynamic properties of the advertisement calls of gray tree frogs: patterns of variability and female choice (1996) Behavioral Ecology, 7, pp. 7-18; Gerhart, H.C., Huber, F., (2002) Acoustic Communication in Insects and Anurans, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Greenfield, M.D., (2002) Signalers and Receivers: Mechanisms and Evolution of Arthropod Communication, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hamilton, W.D., Zuk, M., Heritable true fitness and bright birds: a role for parasites?

As alarm cues can derive from heterospecific as well as conspecific animals, prey may need to fine tune their responses depending on the taxa with which they co-occur. We used juveniles of the freshwater gastropod, Lymnaea stagnalis L. (great pond snail) to test whether the response to heterospecific alarm cues could be enhanced by cohabitation in the absence of predators, and therefore without the potential for cue association learning. Snails were raised from oviposition alongside one of four other pulmonate species, differing in their phylogenetic relatedness to L. stagnalis, that is, from intragenus to intrasuborder. The antipredator response to heterospecific alarm cues paired with fish kairomones was then compared with the response of L. stagnalis reared in isolation. Cohabitation increased the response to heterospecific alarm cues paired with fish kairomones only when L. stagnalis had developed in the presence of closely related (Lymnaea fusca and Radix balthica) rather than distantly related heterospecifics (Physella acuta and Planorbarius corneus). Hence, in L. stagnalis, learning to recognize heterospecific alarm cues can occur without the need for cue association but the learnt response is constrained by species' relatedness. This result suggests that differential responses observed in studies based on wild-caught animals in response to heterospecific alarm cues may be explained by learning through cohabitation alone. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","antipredator behaviour; chemical communication; cohabitation; gastropod; great pond snail; learning; Lymnaea stagnalis; phylogeny","alarm signal; antipredator defense; auditory cue; avoidance reaction; cohabitation; freshwater environment; juvenile; kairomone; learning; phylogeny; relatedness; snail; Animalia; Basommatophora; Gastropoda; Lymnaea; Lymnaea stagnalis; Physa acuta; Planorbarius corneus; Radix balthica",,,,,,"ASTM, Standard practise for conducting acute toxicity tests with fishes, macroinvertebrates and amphibians (1980) Annual Book of ASTM Standards, p. 406. , American Society for Testing and Materials, Philidelphia, Pennsylvania p. 406; Brönmark, C., Effects of tench and perch on interactions in a fresh-water, benthic food-chain (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1818-1828. , 10.2307/1939640; Brown, G.E., Magnavacca, G., Predator inspection behaviour in a characin fish: an interaction between chemical and visual information?

Results from cooperatively breeding species are clearer, where sex-biased dispersal and helping behaviour may accentuate any differences in fitness payoffs to parents of raising sons versus daughters. We might expect similar payoff differences for cooperative helpers raising offspring of each sex, but this has rarely been tested. Bell miners, Manorina melanophrys, are known to adjust their primary brood sex ratio according to habitat productivity. Helpers of both sexes provision broods even when unrelated to offspring, which indicates the potential importance of direct fitness benefits (e.g. group augmentation) that should depend heavily on offspring sex. As only females disperse, we anticipated helpers would invest more heavily in male-biased broods, particularly if they were unrelated to broods and thus not gaining indirect benefits. Helpers did feed all-male broods at a greater rate, although, contrary to expectations, this was the result of higher levels of effort by related and not unrelated helpers, irrespective of helper sex. The subsequent interaction between relatedness and brood sex ratio was also an exclusively between-subjects effect, and not due to any within-subject facultative adjustment by individual helpers feeding at multiple nests. Furthermore, the acoustic characteristics of nestling begging calls showed no reliable sex differences; thus helpers probably lacked accurate information on nestling sex to make facultative adjustments according to brood sex ratio. Additional work examining these kinds of trade-offs in other cooperative species where sons and daughters yield differing payoffs to helpers is warranted. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","bell miner; direct benefit; group augmentation; indirect benefit; kin selection; Manorina melanophrys; sex allocation","begging behavior; eusociality; fitness; habitat quality; kin selection; parental investment; passerine; relatedness; reproductive effort; sex allocation; sex ratio; Aves; Manorina melanophrys; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Brown, J.L., (1987) Helping and Communal Breeding in Birds, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Cassey, P., Ewen, J.G., Møller, A.P., Revised evidence for facultative sex ratio adjustment in birds: a correction (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 3129-3130; Charif, R.A., Clark, C.W., Fristrup, K.M., (2004) Raven 1.2 User's Manual, , Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York; Clarke, M.F., The pattern of helping in the bell miner (Manorina melanophrys) (1989) Ethology, 80, pp. 292-306; Clarke, M.F., Heathcote, C.F., Dispersal, survivorship and demography in the cooperatively breeding bell miner Manorina melanophrys (1990) Emu, 90, pp. 15-23; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Russell, A.F., Sharpe, L.L., Young, A.J., Balmforth, Z., McIlrath, G.M., Evolution and development of sex differences in cooperative behavior in meerkats (2002) Science, 297, pp. 253-256; Cockburn, A., Evolution of helping behavior in cooperatively breeding birds (1998) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 29, pp. 141-177; Cockburn, A., Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 273, pp. 1375-1383; Cockburn, A., Legge, S., Double, M.C., Sex ratios in birds and mammals: can the hypotheses be disentangled?

However, in many species mate guarding commences when females are juveniles and may be several moults from sexual maturity. Such behaviour is inconsistent with the above prediction. In the Zeus bug, Phoreticovelia disparata, sexual size dimorphism is very pronounced and adult males commence riding on the backs of juvenile fourth-instar females. Males derive direct benefits from this association but the fitness consequences of precopulatory male riding behaviour for females are unknown. We investigated the effect of male presence during juvenile development for female Zeus bugs. We found a dramatic cost of male riding for females allocated a mate from the fourth instar: they were less likely to survive to adulthood and had substantially reduced adult longevity. These costs were significantly reduced for females allocated a mate during their fifth instar or as adults. We found no evidence that male presence affected female development time, adult size, body shape or the number of melanized dorsal scars present on their abdomen. Our study indicates that adult females and older juvenile females (fifth instar) are adapted to bear the costs imposed by riding males but that sexual conflict is likely to be intense between males and fourth-instar females.

In a communication context, the personality of an individual may both affect and be affected by the behaviour of the individuals surrounding it within a network. We investigated the effects of a change of local social environment on two behavioural types, 'persistent' versus 'sporadic' signaller, in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. Males visually interacted for 1 day in a communication network of seven fish in tanks arranged in a hexagonal grid, while we recorded space use and signalling data. We then exchanged the positions of two males with different behavioural types and observed them interacting the following day. 'Persistent' signallers were unaffected by the treatment, while 'sporadic' signallers increased the time spent in the inner front part of their tank, from which they could observe but not interact with the neighbours. Social instability (i.e. number of changed neighbours) raised the signalling levels of individuals independently of their behavioural types. We discuss the relationship between information gathering in a communication network and network composition in terms of behavioural types of its members. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression; behavioural type; Betta splendens; communication network; personality; Siamese fighting fish; temperament; visual signal","aggression; behavioral ecology; communication behavior; freshwater environment; interspecific interaction; teleost; Betta splendens; Macropodinae",,,,,,"Bell, A.M., Future directions in behavioural syndromes research (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 755-761; Bronstein, P.M., On the predictability, sensitization, and habituation of aggression in male bettas (Betta splendens) (1994) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 108, pp. 45-57; Carere, C., Eens, M., Unravelling animal personalities: how and why individuals consistently differ (2005) Behaviour, 142, pp. 1149-1157; Croft, D.P., James, R., Thomas, P.O.R., Hathaway, C., Mawdsley, D., Laland, K.N., Krause, J., Social structure and co-operative interactions in a wild population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59, pp. 644-650; Dabelsteen, T., Public, private or anonymous?

To do this, and to adapt their behaviour suitably when faced with a rival, individuals may rely on two nonmutually exclusive recognition means: they could recognize group members individually and/or their social status. Within insect societies, although conflicts over reproduction resulting in hierarchy establishment are widespread, relatively little is known about the cognitive abilities involved in the regulation of agonistic interactions. We tested whether low-ranking workers of Pachycondyla apicalis ants are able to discriminate each other individually and/or if they can discriminate the status of their nestmates. We found no evidence of individual discrimination among subordinates whereas they were able to discriminate their nestmates on the basis of their social and reproductive status. Such a skill may allow them to regulate worker reproduction in queenright colonies efficiently. By considering the structure of the hierarchy and the nature of the dominance relationships in P. apicalis societies, we discuss the existence of a more accurate recognition system among the high-ranking workers. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","dominance; hierarchy; individual discrimination; Pachycondyla apicalis; recognition; social insect; status discrimination","adaptation; agonistic behavior; ant; cognition; dominance; hierarchical system; nestmate recognition; reproductive status; social insect; Animalia; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Pachycondyla apicalis",,,,,,"Alexander, R.D., Aggressiveness, territoriality, and sexual behaviour in field crickets (1961) Behaviour, 17, pp. 130-223; Appleby, M.C., The probability of linearity in hierarchies (1983) Animal Behaviour, 31, pp. 600-608; Arbuthnott, D., Crespi, B.J., Courtship and mate discrimination within and between species of Timema walking-sticks (2009) Animal Behaviour, 78, pp. 53-59; Barnard, C.J., Burk, T., Dominance hierarchies and the evolution of individual recognition (1979) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 81, pp. 65-73; Beaugrand, J.P., Relative importance of initial individual differences, agonistic experience, and assessment accuracy during hierarchy formation: a simulation study (1997) Behavioural Processes, 41, pp. 177-192; Bird, C.D., Emery, N.J., Using video playback to investigate the social preferences of rooks, Corvus frugilegus (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 679-687; Bloch, G., Simon, T., Robinson, G.E., Hefetz, A., Brain biogenic amines and reproductive dominance in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) (2000) Journal of Comparative Physiology A, Neuroethology Sensory Neural and Behavioral Physiology, 186, pp. 261-268; Boulay, R., Hefetz, A., Soroker, V., Lenoir, A., Camponotus fellah colony integration: worker individuality necessitates frequent hydrocarbon exchanges (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 1127-1133; Boulay, R., Hooper-Bui, L.M., Woodring, J., Oviposition and oogenesis in virgin fire ant females Solenopsis invicta are associated with a high level of dopamine in the brain (2001) Physiological Entomology, 26, pp. 294-299; Bourke, A.F.G., Worker reproduction in the higher eusocial Hymenoptera (1988) Quarterly Review of Biology, 63, pp. 291-311; Bourke, A.F.G., Franks, N.R., (1995) Social Evolution in Ants, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Brunner, E., Kroiss, J., Heinze, J., Chemical correlates of reproduction and worker policing in a myrmicine ant (2009) Journal of Insect Physiology, 55, pp. 19-26; Caldwell, R.L., A test of individual recognition in the stomatopod Gonodactylus festae (1985) Animal Behaviour, 33, pp. 101-106; Chapuisat, M., Evolution: social selection for eccentricity (2004) Current Biology, 14, pp. 1003-1004; Cole, B.J., The social behaviour of Leptothorax allardycei (Hymenoptera, Formicidae): time budgets and the evolution of worker reproduction (1986) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 18, pp. 165-173; Cuvillier-Hot, V., Lenoir, A., Biogenic amine levels, reproduction and social dominance in the queenless ant Streblognathus peetersi (2006) Naturwissenschaften, 93, pp. 149-153; Cuvillier-Hot, V., Cobb, M., Malosse, C., Peeters, C., Sex, age and ovarian activity affect cuticular hydrocarbons in Diacamma ceylonense, a queenless ant (2001) Journal of Insect Physiology, 47, pp. 485-493; Cuvillier-Hot, V., Gadagkar, R., Peeters, C., Cobb, M., Regulation of reproduction in a queenless ant: aggression, pheromones and reduction in conflict (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 1295-1300; Cuvillier-Hot, V., Lenoir, A., Crewe, R., Malosse, C., Peeters, C., Fertility signalling and reproductive skew in queenless ants (2004) Animal Behaviour, 68, pp. 1209-1219; Denis, D., Blatrix, R., Fresneau, D., How an ant manages to display individual and colonial signals by using the same channel (2006) Journal of Chemical Ecology, 32, pp. 1647-1661; Denis, D., Chameron, S., Costille, L., Pocheville, A., Châline, L., Fresneau, D., Workers' agonistic interactions in queenright and queenless nests of a polydomous ant society (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 791-800; D'Ettorre, P., Heinze, J., Individual recognition in ant queens (2005) Current Biology, 15, pp. 2170-2174; D'Ettorre, P., Heinze, J., Schultz, C., Francke, W., Ayasse, M., Does she smell like a queen?

Superficially this response seems maladaptive because the decline in food intake occurs at the same time as immune activation increases energy expenditure. However, illness-induced anorexia could be beneficial by decreasing trade-offs between the immune system and digestion. For example, in insects (i.e. crickets) there is a trade-off between lipid transport and immune function. We predicted that increasing the need for lipid transport (e.g. when digesting a high fat meal) would reduce immune function. After consuming a high fat meal, crickets (Gryllus texensis) showed an increase in haemolymph lipid concentration. Crickets also showed a decrease in resistance to bacterial infection (Serratia marcescens). After an immune challenge, crickets not only ate less, they also preferred foods containing less fat. This occurred whether the target food was an ecologically valid food item (dead cricket), natural foods (e.g. lettuce and ground meat) or an artificial diet containing different amounts of lipid. Therefore, the change in feeding behaviour after an immune challenge is consistent with the need to reduce lipid transport in order to maximize immune function. Illness-induced anorexia may be one method by which animals can bias physiological pathways towards enhanced immune function. Some behaviours may be adaptive because they can bias the direction of physiological trade-offs. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","apolipophorin III; cricket; ecological immunology; feeding; food choice; Gryllus; insect; lipid; psychoneuroimmunology; sickness behaviour","bacterium; bioenergetics; cricket; digestion; disease; disease resistance; feeding behavior; food intake; immune response; physiology; trade-off; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gryllidae; Gryllus; Gryllus texensis; Hexapoda; Lactuca; Serratia marcescens",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Estimating disease resistance in insects: phenoloxidase and lysozyme-like activity and disease resistance in the cricket Gryllus texensis (2004) Journal of Insect Physiology, 50, pp. 209-216; Adamo, S.A., How should behavioural ecologists interpret measurements of immunity?

Web decorations are purported to be structures that some orb-weaving spiders build to transmit deceptive signals to their advantage. Cyclosa ginnaga incorporates a variety of silk (silk decorations) and plant materials (plant detritus decorations) into its webs as decorations. It has been hypothesized that web decorations are deceptive signals that either attract prey, provide protection through camouflage or act as a warning signal. Nevertheless, despite numerous studies on web decorations, their function has remained elusive because of conflicting results. Using a combination of field video recording and the quantification of colour contrasts in the visual systems of hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predators, we tested two functional hypotheses (prey attraction and predator defence) of two forms of web decorations (silk spiral and plant detritus) built by C. ginnaga. Silk-decorated, and to a lesser extent plant-decorated, webs intercepted more prey than undecorated webs, thus improving foraging success. This supports the prey attraction hypothesis; however, we could not rule out the predator defence hypothesis because there was no predation on spiders observed for any web with or without decorations. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","achromatic contrast; camouflage; chromatic contrast; Cyclosa ginnaga; orb-weaving spider; prey attraction; signalling; web decoration","antipredator defense; foraging behavior; insect; passerine; phytodetritus; signaling; spider; survival; vision; Animalia; Araneae; Aves; Cyclosa; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Basolo, A.L., Phylogenetic evidence for the role of pre-existing bias in sexual selection (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 259, pp. 307-311; Blackledge, T.A., Wenzel, J.W., Do stabilimenta in orb-webs attract prey or defend spiders (1999) Behavioral Ecology, 10, pp. 372-376; Blackledge, T.A., Wenzel, J.W., Silk mediated defense by an orb web spider against predatory mud-dauber wasps (2001) Behaviour, 138, pp. 155-171; Blamires, S.J., Hochuli, D.F., Thompson, M.B., Why cross the web: decoration spectral properties and prey capture in an orb spider (Argiope keyserlingi) web (2008) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 94, pp. 221-229; Briscoe, A.D., Chittka, L., The evolution of colour vision in insects (2001) Annual Review of Entomology., 46, pp. 471-510; Bruce, M.J., Silk decorations: controversy and consensus (2006) Journal of Zoology, 269, pp. 89-97; Bruce, M.J., Heiling, A.M., Herberstein, M.E., Web decorations and foraging success in 'Araneus' eburnus (Araneae: Araneidae) (2004) Annales Zoologici Fennici, 41, pp. 563-575; Bruce, M.J., Heiling, A.M., Herberstein, M.E., Spider signals: are web decorations visible to birds and bees?

Studies have previously investigated exploratory behaviour in novel laboratory environments, but never during colonization of natural systems. Experimentally releasing and monitoring animals would allow testing of laboratory and computer-simulation hypotheses. We sequentially released and tracked three adult male brown rats, Rattus norvegicus, on a rat-free island, monitoring their movements hourly for 3 weeks to test laboratory and simulation-generated hypotheses of how animals explore and move in novel environments. We found that (1) individual movements are apparently random; (2) range size increases most rapidly in the first week after arrival; (3) range size is larger than for individuals at high density; (4) movement is mediated by central place foraging behaviour. These findings contradict laboratory hypotheses of nonrandom exploration but support simulation search strategy hypotheses. Random movement and increased ranges at low density have implications for understanding animal colonization dynamics and intercepting invasive species arriving at new locations. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","brown rat; density; exploration; invasive; island; movement; radiotelemetry; Rattus norvegicus","behavioral ecology; colonization; environmental conditions; foraging behavior; hypothesis testing; invasive species; movement; radiotelemetry; range size; rodent; survival; Animalia; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus",,,,,,"Benhamou, S., Spatial memory and searching efficiency (1994) Animal Behaviour, 47, pp. 1423-1433; Birke, L.I.A., Archer, J., Some issues and problems in the study of animal exploration (1983) Exploration in Animals and Humans, pp. 1-21. , Archer J., and Birke L.I.A.

However, as the chemicals involved in the condition-dependent signals have rarely been identified, evolutionary mechanisms that ensure their reliability are not well understood. We identified a volatile chemical signal that may serve as a reliable indicator of hormonal state in burying beetles, and is involved in their partner recognition system. Burying beetles reproducing on carcasses are able to distinguish between their breeding partners and infanticidal conspecifics. This discrimination depends on breeding status, which is positively linked to juvenile hormone III (JH III) titre. Breeding Nicrophorus vespilloides beetles, in contrast to nonbreeding ones, emitted considerable amounts of (E)-methylgeranate. The amount of emitted (E)-methylgeranate was positively correlated with juvenile hormone titres known from other burying beetle studies. Moreover, our behavioural experiments showed that dummies treated with methylgeranate induced tolerant behaviour, whereas control dummies were treated aggressively. The fact that (E)-methylgeranate and JH III share a conspicuous structural similarity and the same biosynthetic pathway may explain how the reliability of the signal for JH titre is ensured. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of theoretical work on the evolution of chemical communication, particularly on the origin of chemical signals. © 2009.","breeding status; burying beetle; chemical communication; chemical signal; juvenile hormone; methylgeranate; Nicrophorus vespilloides","beetle; behavioral response; chemical cue; chemical substance; hormone; reproductive success; Animalia; Coleoptera; Nicrophorus vespilloides",,,,,,"Alberts, A.C., Constraints on the design of chemical communication systems in terrestrial vertebrates (1992) American Naturalist, 139, pp. S62-S89; Bellés, X., Martin, D., Piulachs, M.D., The mevalonate pathway and the synthesis of juvenile hormone in insects (2005) Annual Review of Entomology, 50, pp. 181-199; Bradbury, J., Vehrencamp, S., (1998) Principles of Animal Communication, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts; Cardé, R.T., Baker, T.C., Sexual communication with pheromones (1984) Chemical Ecology of Insects, pp. 355-383. , Bell W.J., and Cardé R.T.

Several mammal vocalizations, including domestic dog growls, encode reliable information about caller body size in the dispersion of formant frequencies. To test whether adult domestic dogs attend to formant dispersion when presented with the growls of their conspecifics, we played recordings of resynthesized growls where the size-related variation in formant frequency spacing was manipulated independently of all other parameters. Subjects from three different size groups (small, medium and large dogs) were presented with playbacks of growls where formant frequencies had been rescaled to correspond to a dog 30% smaller or 30% larger than themselves. While large dogs systematically displayed more motivation to interact when growls simulated a smaller intruder, small dogs did not respond differentially to the playback conditions. However, the small dogs responded significantly less than all other size groups to both playback conditions. Our results suggest that domestic dogs are able to perceive size-related information in growls, and more specifically that they are able to adapt their behavioural response as a function of the perceived intruder's size relative to their own. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Canis familiaris; domestic dog; formant dispersion; growling; playback experiment; PSOLA; size assessment; vocal communication","adaptation; agonistic behavior; behavioral response; body size; canid; domestic species; vocalization; Canis familiaris; Mammalia",,,,,,"Cantalupo, C., McCain, D., Ward, J.P., Function of head-cocking in Garnett's greater bush baby (Otolemur garnettii) (2002) International Journal of Primatology, 23, pp. 203-221; Charlton, B.D., Reby, D., McComb, K., Female perception of size-related formant shifts in red deer (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 707-714; Charlton, B.D., Reby, D., McComb, K., Female red deer prefer the roars of larger males (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 382-385; Charlton, B.D., McComb, K., Reby, D., Free-ranging red deer hinds show greater attentiveness to roars with formant frequencies typical of young males (2008) Ethology, 114, pp. 1023-1031; Charlton, B.D., Reby, D., McComb, K., Effect of combined source (F0) and filter (formant) variation on red deer hind responses to male roars (2008) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 123, pp. 2936-2943; Charlton, B.D., Zhang, Z., Snyder, R.J., The information content of giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, bleats: acoustic cues to sex, age and size (2009) Animal Behaviour, 78, pp. 893-898. , 10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.06.029; Cohen, J.A., Fox, M.W., Vocalizations in wild canids and possible effects of domestication (1976) Behavioural Proceedings, 1, pp. 77-92; Coppinger, R., Coppinger, L., (2001) DOGS: A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution, , New York: Scribner; Fant, G., (1960) Acoustic Theory of Speech Production, , Mouton, The Hague, Netherlands; Fitch, W.T., Vocal tract length and formant frequency dispersion correlate with body size in rhesus macaques (1997) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 102, pp. 1213-1222; Fitch, W.T., Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: reinterpreting the descent of the larynx (2002) The Transition to Language, pp. 21-45. , Wray A.

Nevertheless, little is known so far about the pressures under which these signals evolved. We studied loud calls in wild crested macaques to examine whether these are used as a sexual signal, particularly as a signal of dominance, in this species. Since the structure of loud calls may be influenced by the context in which they are uttered, we tested for contextual differences in call structure. Only males uttered loud calls and analysis of 194 loud calls given by 15 males showed that call structure encoded the caller's identity as well as his social status. Dominance rank was also reflected in the frequency with which males called with alpha males calling most often. The structure of loud calls, however, was not influenced by context. Our findings consolidate the assumption that, in crested macaques, loud calls serve as a signal of dominance, most probably used to prevent contests between males for mates. We herewith provide the first direct evidence for a signal of dominance in a tolerant primate species and discuss why this signal occurs in only one sex. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","crested macaque; dominance signal; loud call; Macaca nigra; sexual selection; sexual signal; social style","calling behavior; dominance; primate; sexual selection; signaling; social behavior; Macaca; Macaca nigra; Mammalia; Primates",,,,,,"Baker, S., Mulligan, B.E., Kohlhaas, A., Pramono, A.H., 'Loud calls' of Macaca nigrescens in Dumoga-Bone National Park, North Sulawesi (1991) American Journal of Primatology, 24, pp. 87-88. , [Abstract]; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, B (Methodological), 57, pp. 289-300; Bradley, B.J., Mundy, N.I., The primate palette: the evolution of primate coloration (2008) Evolutionary Anthropology, 17, pp. 97-111. , 10.1002/evan.20164; Chaffin, C.L., Friedlen, K., de Waal, F.B.M., Dominance style of Japanese macaques compared with rhesus and stumptail macaques (1995) American Journal of Primatology, 35, pp. 103-116. , 10.1002/ajp.1350350203; Collins, N.M., Sayer, J.A., Whitmore, T.C., (1991) The Conservation Atlas of Tropical Forests: Asia and the Pacific, , Simon & Schuster, New York; da Cunha, R.G.T., Byrne, R.W., Roars of black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya): evidence for a function in inter-group spacing (2006) Behaviour, 143, pp. 1169-1199. , 10.1163/156853906778691568; Darwin, C., Sexual selection in relation to monkeys (1876) Nature, 15, pp. 18-19. , 10.1038/015018a0; Delgado, R.A., Sexual selection in the loud calls of male primates: signal content and function (2006) International Journal of Primatology, 27, pp. 5-25. , 10.1007/s10764-005-9001-4; Delson, E., Fossil macaques, phyletic relationships and a scenario of deployment (1980) The Macaques: Studies in Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution, pp. 10-30. , Lindburg D.G.

Previous studies conducted with puppies as young as 6 weeks old have reported that puppies are able to follow a human pointing gesture, even when they have had little human contact. These results have led some experimenters to conclude that ontogeny does not contribute to dogs' ability to understand human cues. To determine the age at which domestic dogs first show the ability to understand human pointing cues, we tested puppies in their human caregivers' homes when the puppies were 9-24 weeks old. We found little evidence that puppies younger than 21 weeks had the ability to follow human pointing gestures. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Canis; dog; human gesture; momentary proximal point; puppy; social cognition","canid; cognition; communication behavior; domestic species; interspecific interaction; ontogeny; Canis; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Agnetta, B., Hare, B., Tomasello, M., Cues to food location that domestic dogs of different ages do and do not use (2000) Animal Cognition, 3, pp. 107-112; Behne, T., Carpenter, M., Tomasello, M., One-year-olds comprehend and communicative intentions behind gestures in a hiding game (2005) Developmental Science, 8, pp. 492-499; Bräuer, J., Kaminski, J., Call, J., Tomasello, M., Making inferences about the location of hidden food: social dog, casual ape (2006) Journal of Comparative Analysis, 130, pp. 38-43; Butterworth, G., Joint visual attention in infancy (2001) Blackwell Handbook of Infant Development.

This study is the first to use the eye-tracking method to perform direct comparisons between humans and chimpanzees with regard to face scanning. Members of both species viewed the same sets of photographs representing conspecific and nonconspecific faces under the same experimental conditions. Chimpanzees and humans showed systematic and similar patterns of face scanning, including intensely viewing main facial features (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth) and inspecting the eyes and mouth, in that order. However, several differences between the species were also evident. For example, humans were more likely to show sequential refixations on the eye regions than were chimpanzees, whereas chimpanzees were more likely to engage in quick, vertical scanning over the eyes and mouth. Such species similarities and differences were consistent across conspecific and nonconspecific faces and were thus independent of the external morphologies of species-specific faces. Furthermore, when presented with facial expressions, chimpanzees changed their scanning patterns in response to those facial actions, whereas humans maintained intense eye viewing across the expressions. Finally, we discuss how these face-scanning patterns are related to species-specific forms of facial communication in chimpanzees and humans, and suggest that both species have unique eye movement strategies for interactions with conspecifics. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","chimpanzee; emotional expression; evolution; eye tracking; face; Pan troglodytes","communication behavior; conspecific; eye; image analysis; photograph; primate; vision; Pan; Pan troglodytes",,,,,,"Adachi, I., Chou, D.P., Hampton, R.R., Thatcher effect in monkeys demonstrates conservation of face perception across Primates (2009) Current Biology, 19, pp. 1270-1273; Althoff, R.R., Cohen, N.J., Eye-movement-based memory effect: a reprocessing effect in face perception (1999) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, 25, pp. 997-1010; Argyle, M., Cook, M., (1976) Gaze and Mutual Gaze, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bard, K.A., Myowa-Yamakoshi, M., Tomonaga, M., Tanaka, M., Costall, A., Matsuzawa, T., Group differences in the mutual gaze of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (2005) Developmental Psychology, 41, p. 9; Blais, C., Jack, R.E., Scheepers, C., Fiset, D., Caldara, R., Culture shapes how we look at faces (2008) PLoS ONE, 3 (8); Carpenter, M., Tomasello, M., Joint attention and imitative learning in children, chimpanzees, and enculturated chimpanzees (1995) Social Development, 4, pp. 217-237; Chevalier-Skolnikoff, S., Facial expression of emotion in nonhuman primates (1973) Darwin and Facial Expression: a Century of Research in Review, pp. 11-89. , Ekman P.

Male harassment affects female reproductive success in the laboratory, but few studies have evaluated the costs of male harassment in the wild. In the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, females exhibit colour dimorphism (andromorph and gynomorph), and the morph frequency varies between local populations. In two populations where gynomorphs were common, we found that males harassed more gynomorphs than andromorphs throughout their daily foraging and oviposition activity period. Gynomorphs excreted less faeces than andromorphs, indicating that preferential harassment of gynomorphs decreased their food intake. Gynomorphs also produced fewer eggs than andromorphs. As a result, gynomorphs laid 35% fewer eggs per day than andromorphs, suggesting that male harassment decreased their reproductive success. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","female polymorphism;

The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","breeding season; cooperative breeding; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; Rhabdomys pumilio; space use; striped mouse","body mass; breeding season; female; fitness; home range; interspecific variation; intraspecific competition; radiotelemetry; resource availability; rodent; seasonality; space use; survival; trade-off; Mus; Rhabdomys pumilio",,,,,,"Anderson, P.K., Foraging range in mice and voles: the role of risk (1986) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 64, pp. 2645-2653; Asher, M., Oliveira, S.E., Sachser, N., Social system and spatial organization of wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea) in a natural low density population (2004) Journal of Mammalogy, 85, pp. 788-796; Baker, A.J., Dietz, J.M., Immigration in wild groups of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) (1996) American Journal of Primatology, 38, pp. 47-56; Baker, P.J., Funk, S.M., Harris, S., White, P.C.L., Flexible spatial organization of urban foxes, Vulpes vulpes, before and during an outbreak of sarcoptic mange (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 127-146; Bates, D., Fitting linear mixed models in R (2005) R News, 5, pp. 27-30; Begg, C.M., Begg, K.S., Du Toit, J.T., Mills, M.G.L., Spatial organization of the honey badger Mellivora capensis in the southern Kalahari: home-range size and movement patterns (2005) Journal of Zoology, 265, pp. 23-35; Bell, A.M., Animal personalities (2007) Nature, 447, pp. 539-540; Bixler, A., Gittleman, J.L., Variation in home range and use of habitat in the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) (2000) Journal of Zoology, 251, pp. 525-533; Boonstra, R., Effect of adult townsend voles (Microtus townsendii) on survival of young (1978) Ecology, 59, pp. 242-248; Boutin, S., Food supplementation experiments with terrestrial vertebrates: patterns, problems, and the future (1990) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 68, pp. 203-220; Boutin, S., Schweiger, S., Manipulation of intruder pressure in red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus): effects on territory size and acquisition (1988) Canadian Journal of Zoology, 66, pp. 2270-2274; Bozinovic, F.L., Bacigalupe, D., Vásquez, R.A., Visser, G.H., Veloso, C., Kenagy, G.J., Cost of living in free-ranging degus (Octodon degus): seasonal dynamics of energy expenditure (2004) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A, 137, pp. 597-604; Broughton, S.K., Dickman, C.R., The effect of supplementary food on home range of the southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus (Marsupialia: Peramelidae) (1991) Australian Journal of Ecology, 16, pp. 71-78; Brown, J.S., Kotler, B.P., Smith, R.J., Wirtz, W.O., The effects of owl predation on the foraging behaviour of heteromyid rodents (1988) Oecologia, 76, pp. 408-415; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference.

However, there is debate over the reliability of such displays and low levels of deception may occur within otherwise honest signalling systems. Hermit crabs use displays involving the chelipeds during agonistic encounters. We examined how variation in chelae size in relation to body size, a determinant of fighting ability, affects their use in displays and the process and outcome of contests over gastropod shells. In accordance with deceptive use of an otherwise honest signal, we found that contestants with large chelipeds for their body size spent more time performing the cheliped presentation display. Moreover, cheliped residuals and displays influenced the escalation level of encounters. There was a positive association between cheliped displays and the occurrence of 'grappling', but a negative association between displays and the occurrence of shell fights, suggesting that displays may signal aggressive intent and a reluctance to back off or accept the more passive defender role in a fight. Furthermore, the smaller of the two contestants in shell fights had larger cheliped residuals compared to those smaller contestants not involved in shell fights, which is consistent with disrupted opponent assessment. This study adds to mounting evidence that when acting as a signaller, individuals for whom the display exaggerates competitive ability attempt to manipulate opponents, using the display more often. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","contest; deception; display; hermit crab; honesty; Pagurus bernhardus","body size; crab; display behavior; fighting; gastropod; honest signaling; shell; Animalia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Pagurus bernhardus",,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Mesterton-Gibbons, M., The cost of threat displays and the stability of deceptive communication (1995) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 175, pp. 405-421; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Fighting for shells: how private information about resource value changes hermit crab pre-fight displays and escalated fight behaviour (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, pp. 3011-3017; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Information gathering and decision making about resource value in animal contests (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 529-542; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 991-1004; Backwell, P.R.Y., Christy, J.H., Telford, S.R., Jennions, M.D., Passmore, N.I., Dishonest signalling in a fiddler crab (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 267, pp. 719-724; Bee, M.A., Perrill, S.A., Owen, P.C., Male green frogs lower the pitch of acoustic signals in defense of territories: a possible dishonest signal of size?

For a naïve individual confronted with an array of novel foods, determining the nutritional value of unfamiliar foods can be challenging, and an increased reliance on social learning would be favoured by selection. I investigated whether the multimodal display of food calling and tid-bitting by white-tailed ptarmigan, Lagopus leucurus, hens adaptively biases chicks' intake of foods of different nutrient content via social learning. Ptarmigan were observed in California's Sierra Nevada alpine for two summer seasons. In 116 foraging bouts, I observed 100 instances of hen food calling (to six plant species) and 100 responses by chicks. The relative proportion of each plant species in the chicks' diet was significantly and positively related to the proportion of food calls associated with that plant species, but not with its relative availability. Plant species that elicited food calls by hens had significantly more protein than did random mixtures of plants or than did foods eaten by the hens that did not elicit food calls. Chicks of hens that often uttered calls consumed diets significantly higher in protein than did chicks of hens that rarely called. Preferences were maintained as chicks became older and foraged further from their mothers, and food calling ceased, indicating social learning. Hens' food calling biased chicks' diet choices, supporting the prediction that socially acquired information plays a prominent role when an animal is seeking a nutrient that is difficult to identify (protein). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that ptarmigan hens engage in teaching, but further studies are required before it can be stated conclusively that they teach their chicks nutritional wisdom. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","diet selection; food calling; Lagopus leucurus; social learning; teaching; white-tailed ptarmigan","calling behavior; diet; food intake; gamebird; learning; nutritive value; parent-offspring interaction; protein; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Animalia; Lagopus leucurus",,,,,,"Allen, T., Clarke, J.A., Social learning of food preferences by white-tailed ptarmigan chicks (2005) Animal Behaviour, 70, pp. 305-310; Beck, M., Galef Jr., B.G., Social influences on the selection of a protein-sufficient diet of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) (1989) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 103, pp. 132-139; Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., An evolutionary model of social learning: the effects of spatial and temporal variation (1988) Social Learning: Psychological and Biological Perspectives, pp. 29-48. , Zentall T.R., and Galef Jr. B.G.

Females evolve counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated, costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females, and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid species arise from unfertilized eggs. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","alfalfa leafcutting bee; cost; fecundity; female resistance; Hymenoptera; Megachile rotundata; sex ratio; sexual coercion; sexual conflict; sexual harassment","adaptation; alfalfa; bee; fecundity; fitness; food availability; life history trait; predation risk; reproductive cost; reproductive success; sex ratio; sexual conflict; Apoidea; Hymenoptera; Medicago sativa; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae",,,,,,"Abrol, D.P., Foraging ecology and behaviour of the alfalfa pollinating bee species Megachile nana (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) (1998) Entomologia Generalis, 22, pp. 233-237; Akre, R.D., Catts, E.P., Zack, R.S., Klostermeyer, E.C., Gynandromorphs of Megachile rotundata (Fab) (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae) (1982) Entomological News, 93, pp. 85-94; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Blanchetot, A., DNA fingerprinting analysis in the solitary bee Megachile rotundata-variability and nest mate genetic relationships (1992) Genome, 35, pp. 681-688; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Hosken, D.J., Martin, O.Y., Reim, C., Teuschl, Y., Ward, P.I., The costs of copulating in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea (2002) Behavioral Ecology, 13, pp. 353-358; Cane, J.H., Estimation of bee size using intertegular span (Apoidea) (1987) Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society, 60, pp. 145-147; Chapman, T., Arnqvist, G., Bangham, J., Rowe, L., Sexual conflict (2003) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, pp. 41-47; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Parker, G.A., Sexual coercion in animal societies (1995) Animal Behaviour, 49, pp. 1345-1365; Eberhard, W.G., The function of female resistance behavior: intromission by male coercion vs. female cooperation in sepsid flies (Diptera: Sepsidae) (2002) Revista De Biologia Tropical, 50, pp. 485-505; Eberhard, W.G., Evolutionary conflicts of interest: are female sexual decisions different?

I investigated female choice strategies in the scissortail sergeant, Abudefduf sexfasciatus. In a manipulation experiment where the position of clutches was altered, some females laid small clutches to test males and only went back to males if the test eggs were cared for. Test eggs allowed females to select good fathers, whereas usual predictors of parental quality, such as male body size and courtship rates, seemed ineffective. However, test eggs were used only by 7.4% of females at the very beginning of the male's mating phase, probably because of the high cost of this strategy. When possible, females preferred to mate with already guarding males. By pooling eggs in nests that already contained the clutches of other females, they diluted the cost of predation and cannibalism by the parental male, and obtained higher hatching success for their broods. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Abudefduf sexfasciatus; female choice; filial cannibalism; parental care; scissortail sergeant","body size; cannibalism; female behavior; life history trait; mate choice; mate guarding; paternal care; perciform; reproductive cost; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; sexual selection; Abudefduf sexfasciatus; Pisces; Pomacentridae",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Backwell, P.R.Y., Christy, J.H., Telford, S.R., Jennions, M.D., Passmore, N.I., Dishonest signalling in a fiddler crab (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 267, pp. 719-724; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Coleman, R.M., Gross, M.R., Sargent, R.C., Parental investment decision rules: a test in the bluegill sunfish (1985) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 18, pp. 59-66; Coté, I.M., Hunte, W., Male and female mate choice in the redlip blenny: why bigger is better (1989) Animal Behaviour, 38, pp. 78-88; Dawkins, M.S., Guilford, T., The corruption of honest signalling (1991) Animal Behaviour, 42, pp. 865-873; Dugatkin, L.A., Sexual selection and imitation: females copy the mate choice of others (1992) American Naturalist, 139, pp. 1384-1389; Dugatkin, L.A., Godin, J.-G., Reversal of female mate choice by copying in the guppy Poecilia reticulata (1992) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 249, pp. 179-184; Fishelson, L., Behaviour and ecology of a population of Abudefduf saxatilis (Pomacentridae, Teleostei) at Eilat (Red Sea) (1970) Animal Behaviour, 18, pp. 225-237; FitzGerald, G.J., Filial cannibalism in fishes: why do parents eat their offspring?

We evaluated an intriguing structure whose function has never been thoroughly tested. Specifically, we evaluated the hypothesis that the body-enclosing 'faecal case' created and lived in by the immature stages of Neochlamisus leaf beetles reduces their risk of predation. We especially focus on the case of N. platani, which is externally covered with host-plant trichomes, and includes a distinct trichome-filled chamber ('attic') in the case apex. Here, we separately evaluated the effects of case, trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using N. platani and N. bimaculatus larvae and pupae. Three generalist predators (crickets, soldier bugs and lynx spiders) that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual-level repeated observation behavioural trials. Results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species, life history stage and predator. Additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk. Variation in results among treatments was also informative. For example, the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages. Patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence.

We tested whether guarding males of the western Mexican whiptail lizard, Aspidoscelis costata, reduce energy intake and increase expenditure of energy on male-male aggression. Also, we tested whether guarding males calibrate their aggressive behaviour and feeding to aggression from male rivals (a proxy of their female's probability of extrapair copulation) and body size of the guarded female (positively correlated with fecundity in this species). Observation during and after guarding showed that guarding males (1) ate 77% fewer prey/h and 54% smaller prey, (2) initiated 87% more agonistic interactions/h and (3) participated in 120% more escalated agonistic interactions/h than when alone. Also, guarding males initiated more aggressions when aggression from other males and female size were greater. These results indicate that mate guarding is costly for males because of simultaneous reduction in energy intake and increased expenditure on aggression, and that males incur higher guarding costs when competition with other males and female reproductive value are greater. These costs of mate guarding probably result in negative energy balances that could reduce male fitness through diminished survival. The evolutionary persistence of mate guarding by males can be explained if the net gain in fitness derived from guarding more than offsets its survival costs. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aspidoscelis costata; energetic cost; male cost adjustment; male lizard; mate guarding; whiptail lizard","aggression; bioenergetics; body size; extra-pair copulation; fitness; intraspecific competition; lizard; male behavior; mate guarding; survival; Aspidoscelis costata; Squamata; Teiidae",,,,,,"Abell, A., Costs of reproduction in male lizards, Sceloporus virgatus (2000) Oikos, 88, pp. 630-640. , 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880320.x; Alberts, S.C., Altmann, J., Wilson, M.L., Mate guarding constrains foraging activity of male baboons (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 1269-1277. , 10.1006/anbe.1996.0131; Alcock, J., Post-insemination associations between males and females in insects: the mate guarding hypothesis (1994) Annual Review of Entomology, 39, pp. 1-21. , 10.1146/annurev.en.39.010194.000245; Anderson, R.A., Vitt, L.J., Sexual selection versus alternative causes of sexual dimorphism in teiid lizards (1990) Oecologia, 84, pp. 145-157. , 10.1007/BF00318265; Beecher, M.D., Beecher, I.M., Sociobiology of bank swallows: reproductive strategy of the male (1979) Science, 205, pp. 1282-1285. , 10.1126/science.205.4412.1282; Birkhead, T.R., Mate guarding in the magpie Pica pica (1979) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 277-283. , 10.1016/0003-3472(79)90024-1; Birkhead, T.R., Møller, A.P., (1992) Sperm Competition in Birds: Evolutionary Causes and Consequences, , Academic Press, London; Birkhead, T.R., Møller, A.P., (1998) Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection, , Academic Press, London; Brodmann, P.A., Reyer, H.U., Nestling provisioning in water pipits (Anthus spinoletta): do parents go for specific nutrients or profitable prey?

To understand its complexity in wild animals more fully, a comprehensive investigative approach is needed, in which the multiple resource values and measures of fighting ability that potentially influence intergroup contests are simultaneously considered and controlled for. This study uses long-term data on eight neighbouring groups of folivorous black and white colobus monkeys, Colobus guereza ('guerezas') in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to investigate the factors influencing intergroup conflict. Adult males were the main participants in intergroup aggression. Of the three resource values investigated, food value had the most unambiguous positive effect on the tendency for males to initiate high-level intergroup aggression and for groups to win. Mate value positively influenced male initiation of high-level intergroup aggression, but not more so for the group that contained high-value mates. The presence of young infants had no obvious effects. Unlike in many other species, males were more likely to initiate intergroup aggression if their groups were smaller and contained fewer adult males than opposing groups. Groups with fewer but larger adult males, and to some extent, smaller groups, were more likely to win encounters. Moreover, the relative number of adult males/group largely affected the degree to which some other factors influenced male initiation of aggression and contest outcome. These findings reveal that a complex interplay between multiple resource values and multiple fighting ability measures can simultaneously influence initiation of and success in intergroup conflict. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","animal contest; black and white colobus monkey; Colobus guereza; fighting ability; guereza; intergroup encounter; mate defence; primate; resource defence","fighting; group behavior; mate guarding; primate; resource use; wild population; Kibale National Park; Uganda; Western Province [Uganda]; Animalia; Colobinae; Colobus; Colobus guereza; Primates",,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Boundary disputes in the territorial ant Azteca trigona: effects of asymmetries in colony size (1990) Animal Behaviour, 39, pp. 321-328; Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Boydston, E.E., Morelli, T.L., Holekamp, K.E., Sex differences in territorial behavior exhibited by the spotted hyena (Hyaenidae, Crocuta crocuta) (2001) Ethology, 107, pp. 369-385; Cant, M.A., Otali, E., Mwanguhya, F., Fighting and mating between groups in a cooperatively breeding mammal, the banded mongoose (2002) Ethology, 108, pp. 541-555; Cheney, D.L., Interactions and relationships between groups (1987) Primate Societies, pp. 267-281. , Smuts B., Cheney D.L., Seyfarth R.M., Wrangham R.W., and Struhsakerpp T.T.

We investigated which behavioural group plays the key role in the regulation of recruitment and how it manages to tune the foraging effort according to the level of starvation in the colony. We focused on recruiters and recruits: Recruiters hold information concerning the characteristics of the food source whereas domestics and potential recruits may be better informed about the colony's needs because of the constant contact that they have with their recruits and/or larvae. We imposed different starvation levels on nest-workers and recruiters and observed their interactions. The level of starvation did not alter the behaviour of the recruiters. However, we observed a change in the recruits' response to the recruiter's signal if the starvation level increased. This induced more recruits and thus more workers foraging in starved colonies. In nonstarved colonies, recruits did not respond to the recruitment signal and no recruitment occurred. Our results suggest that the recruits' response is the major key to the regulation of the recruitment process. This study has deciphered how individuals assess the colony's needs and integrate all the information to build up an optimal food exploitation strategy adjusted to starvation. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","ant; foraging; Lasius niger; starvation; sugar transfer; threshold","ant; colonization; foraging behavior; group behavior; recruitment (population dynamics); social insect; starvation; sugar; worker caste; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Lasius niger",,,,,,"Anderson, C., Bartholdi, J.J., Centralized versus decentralized control in manufacturing: lessons from social insects (2000) 'Complexity and Complex Systems in Industry,' Proceedings, University of Warwick, 19th-20th September 2000, pp. 92-108. , McCarthy I.P., and Rakotobe-Joel T.

Here we investigate whether hosts can combat the lethal effects of parasitoids by enhancing their grooming behaviour and removing the parasitoids before they have a chance to enter the host's body. Many field cricket species are stalked and parasitized by gravid females of the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. Female parasitoids lay live first-instar larvae (planidia) on and around the cricket. Planidia burrow into the cricket host where they feed and grow. Because parasitism invariably results in host death, there should be strong selection for crickets to avoid being parasitized. We investigated whether field-caught Texas field crickets, Gryllus texensis, groom to avoid parasitism by O. ochracea. We quantified grooming behaviour of crickets when they were in the same area as O. ochracea adults or larvae (proximity avoidance), and following contact between the cricket and O. ochracea adults or larvae (contact avoidance). Crickets did not adjust grooming behaviour when in close proximity to adult gravid female O. ochracea, nor did they avoid planidia-laden grass. Crickets did, however, substantially increase their grooming activity when placed in an arena filled with planidia-laden grass. Furthermore, crickets that groomed more were much less likely to succumb to parasitoid infestation, compared to crickets that groomed less. Our findings suggest that grooming in G. texensis may function as a strong defence against parasitism by O. ochracea. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","grooming; Gryllus texensis; host-parasite; Ormia ochracea; parasite; parasitoid; planidia; tachinid; Texas field cricket","avoidance reaction; cricket; fly; grass; grooming; host-parasitoid interaction; selection; Gryllidae; Gryllinae; Gryllus texensis; Ormia ochracea; Tachinidae",,,,,,"Adamo, S.A., Evidence for adaptive changes in egg laying in crickets exposed to bacteria and parasites (1999) Animal Behaviour, 57, pp. 117-124; Adamo, S.A., Robert, D., Hoy, R., Effects of a tachinid parasitoid, Ormia ochracea, on the behavior and reproduction of its male and female field cricket hosts (Gryllus spp.) (1995) Journal of Insect Physiology, 41, pp. 269-277; Adamo, S.A., Robert, D., Perez, J., Hoy, R.R., The response of an insect parasitoid, Ormia ochracea (Tachinidae), to the uncertainty of larval success during infestation (1995) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 36, pp. 111-118; Amo, L., Galván, I., Tomás, G., Sanz, J.J., Predator odour recognition and avoidance in a songbird (2008) Functional Ecology, 22, pp. 289-293; Baker, R.L., Smith, B.P., Conflict between antipredator and antiparasite behaviour in larval damselflies (1997) Oecologia, 109, pp. 622-628; Buchler, R., Drescher, W., Tornier, I., Grooming behavior of Apis cerana, Apis mellifera and Apis dorsata and its effect on the parasitic mites Varroa jacobsonia and Tropilaelaps clareae (1993) Experimental and Applied Acarology, 16, pp. 313-319; Cade, W.H., Acoustically orienting parasitoids: fly phonotaxis to cricket song (1975) Science, 190, pp. 1312-1313; Chivers, D.P., Wisenden, B.D., Smith, R.J.F., Damselfly larvae learn to recognize predators from chemical cues in the predator's diet (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 315-320; Eckstein, R.A., Hart, B.L., Grooming and control of fleas in cats (2000) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 68, pp. 141-150; Forbes, M.R.L., Ectoparasites and mating success of male Enallagma ebrium damselflies (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) (1991) Oikos, 60, pp. 336-342; Forbes, M.R.L., Baker, R.L., Susceptibility to parasitism: experiments with the damselfly Enallagma ebrium (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) and larval water mites, Arrenurus spp. (Acari: Arrenuridae) (1990) Oikos, 58, pp. 61-66; Forbes, M.R.L., Baker, R.L., Condition and fecundity of the damselfly, Enallagma ebrium (Hagen): the importance of ectoparasites (1991) Oecologia, 86, pp. 335-341; Giorgi, M.S., Arlettaz, R., Christe, P., Vogel, P., The energetic costs imposed by a parasitic mite (Spinturnix myoti) upon its bat host (Myotis myotis) (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 268, pp. 2071-2075; Hart, B.L., Behavioral adaptations to pathogens and parasites: five strategies (1990) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 14, pp. 273-294; Hedrick, A.V., Kortet, R.K., Hiding behaviour in two cricket populations that differ in predation pressure (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 1111-1118; Keymer, A.E., Read, A.F., Behavioural ecology: the impact of parasitism (1991) Parasitism: Coexistence or Conflict, pp. 37-61. , Toft C., Aeschlimann A., and Bolis L.

It has repeatedly, although controversially, been argued that such wariness can contribute to the evolution of bright coloration in prey animals with effective secondary defences such as toxins. In this paper we report the results of novel evolutionary simulations in which bright prey emerge in otherwise cryptic, defended populations, and predators vary in their level of dietary wariness. A novel prediction from our simulations is that rare aposematic prey can evolve to a dynamic equilibrium with their cryptic conspecifics, and persist for long evolutionary timescales without ever reaching fixation in prey populations. Furthermore, we show that when conditions are more beneficial for new aposematic forms, for example because there are many palatable prey in a habitat, then dietary conservatism can indeed explain the evolution of aposematism, but the generality of this result was considerably restricted by variation in levels of dietary conservatism seen within predator populations and by increased predator longevity. We use the results to consider the case that 'receiver biases' could explain aposematism, rather than recently suggested models of signal reliability. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aposematism; avoidance learning; crypsis; dietary conservatism; frequency-dependent selection; individual-based modelling; neophobia","adaptation; antipredator defense; aposematism; avoidance reaction; color; feeding behavior; life history trait; longevity; predator; Animalia",,,,,,"Coppinger, R.P., The effect of experience and novelty on avian feeding behaviour with reference to the evolution of warning coloration in butterflies.
