An underexplored explanation for imperfect mimicry is that predators might not be able to use all dimensions of prey phenotype to distinguish mimics from models and thus permit imperfect mimicry to persist. We conducted a field experiment to test whether or not predators can distinguish deadly coral snakes (Micrurus fulvius) from nonvenomous scarlet kingsnakes (Lampropeltis elapsoides). Although the two species closely resemble one another, the order of colored rings that encircle their bodies differs. Despite this imprecise mimicry, we found that L. elapsoides that match coral snakes in other respects are not under selection to match the ring order of their model. We suggest that L. elapsoides have evolved only those signals necessary to deceive predators. Generally, imperfect mimicry might suffice if it exploits limitations in predator cognitive abilities. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptation; Batesian mimicry; Color pattern; Coral snake; Predation","adaptation; cognition; color morph; mimicry; phenotypic plasticity; predator; snake",,,,,,"Bain, R.S., Rashed, A., Cowper, V.J., Gilbert, F.S., Sherratt, T.N., The key mimetic features of hoverflies through avian eyes (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274, pp. 1949-1954; Bates, D., Fitting linear mixed models in R (2005) R News, 5, pp. 27-30; Bates, H.W., Contributions to an insect fauna of the Amazon valley (Lepidoptera: Heliconidae) (1862) Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, 23, pp. 495-556; Brodie III, E.D., Differential avoidance of coral snake banded patterns by free-ranging avian predators in Costa Rica (1993) Evolution, 47, pp. 227-235; Caley, M.J., Schluter, D., Predators favour mimicry in a tropical reef fish (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 270, pp. 667-672; Carter, G.S., Colour and colour vision in animals (1948) Nature, 162, pp. 600-601; Chittka, L., Osorio, D., Cognitive dimensions of predator responses to imperfect mimicry?

Despite the widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes. Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities. We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to the well-known traveling salesman problem. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bombus terrestris; Pollination ecology; Spatial cognition; Trapline foraging; Traveling salesman problem","bee; feeding ground; flower visiting; memory; optimization; spatial cognition",,,,,,"Anderson, D.J., Optimal foraging and the traveling salesman (1983) Theoretical Population Biology, 24, pp. 145-159; Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvátal, V., Cook, W.J., (2006) The Travelling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bonabeau, E., Dorigo, M., Theraulaz, G., Inspiration for optimization from social insect behaviour (2000) Nature, 406, pp. 39-42; Bures, J., Buresova, O., Nerad, L., Can rats solve a simple version of the traveling salesman problem?

These effects are often mainly negative, but a growing number of studies suggest that under certain environmental conditions early experience of such stress may yield individuals that are less sensitive to environmental stress later on in life. We used the butterfly Bicyclus anynana to study the effects of limited larval and adult food and forced flight on individual performance measured as reproduction and adult life span. Larvae exposed to food stress showed longer development and produced smaller adults. Thus, they were not able to fully compensate for the food deprivation during development. Females that experienced food stress during development did not increase tolerance for adult food limitation. However, females exposed to food stress during development coped better with forced flight compared with the control group. The apparent absence of costs of flight in poor-quality females may be a by-product of an altered body allocation, as females experiencing both food stress treatments had increased thorax ratios, compared with controls, and increased flight performances. The results reveal an important plasticity component to variation in flight performance and suggest that the cost of flight depends on an individual's internal condition. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Environment; Flight; Life history; Nutrition limitation; Stress; Trade-off","butterfly; environmental stress; evolutionarily stable strategy; fitness; flight activity; life history trait; life table; nutritional status; trade-off",,,,,,"Barrett, E.L.B., Hunt, J., Moore, A.J., Moore, P.J., Separate and combined effects of nutrition during juvenile and sexual development on female life-history trajectories: The thrifty phenotype in a cockroach (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, pp. 3257-3264; Bauerfeind, S.S., Fischer, K., Effects of adult-deprived carbohydrates, amino acids and micronutrients on female reproduction in a fruit-feeding butterfly (2005) Journal of Insect Physiology, 51, pp. 545-554; Effects of food stress and density in different life stages on reproduction in a butterfly (2005) Oikos, 111, pp. 514-524; Effects of larval starvation and adult diet-derived amino acids on reproduction in a fruit-feeding butterfly (2009) Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata, 130, pp. 229-237; Berwaerts, K., Van Dyck, H., Take-off performance under optimal and suboptimal thermal conditions in the butterfly Pararge aegeria (2004) Oecologia (Berlin), 141, pp. 536-545; Berwaerts, K., Van Dyck, H., Aerts, P., Does flight morphology relate to flight performance? an experimental test with the butterfly Pararge aegeria (2002) Functional Ecology, 16, pp. 484-491; Bijlsma, R.R., Loeschke, V., (1997) Environmental Stress: Adaptation and Evolution, , Birkhäuser, Basel; Boggs, C.L., Understanding insect life histories and senescence through a resource allocation lens (2009) Functional Ecology, 23, pp. 27-37; Boggs, C.L., Freeman, K.D., Larval food limitation in butterflies: Effects of adult resource allocation and fitness (2005) Oecologia (Berlin), 144, pp. 353-361; Bonte, D., Travis, J.M.J., De Clercq, N., Zwertvaegher, I., Lens, L., Thermal conditions during juvenile development affect adult dispersal in a spider (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 105, pp. 17000-17005; Brakefield, P.M., Phenotypic plasticity and fluctuating asymmetry as responses to environmental stress in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana (1997) Environmental Stress, Adaptation and Evolution, pp. 65-78. , in R.

Phenotypic plasticity in adult life-history decisions may help to mitigate these potential costs, yet adult life-history responses to juvenile food conditions remain largely unexplored. I used a foodmanipulation experiment with female Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to examine age-related changes in adult life-history responses to early food conditions, whether these responses varied across different adult food conditions, and how these responses affected overall reproductive success. Guppy females reared on low food as juveniles matured at a later age, at a smaller size, and with less energy reserves than females reared on high food as juveniles. In response to this setback, they changed their investment in growth, reproduction, and fat storage throughout the adult stage such that they were able to catch up in body size, increase their reproductive output, and restore their energy reserves to levels comparable to those of females reared on high food as juveniles. The net effect was that adult female guppies did not merely mitigate but surprisingly were able to fully compensate for the potential long-term negative effects of poor juvenile food conditions on reproductive success. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Allocation; Early conditions; Life history; Phenotypic plasticity; Poecilia reticulata","cyprinid; food availability; juvenile; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive success; sex allocation",,,,,,"Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Devevey, G., Prost, J., Faivre, B., Sorci, G., Increased susceptibility to oxidative stress as a proximate cost of reproduction (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 363-368; Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Devevey, G., Prost, J., Faivre, B., Chastel, O., Sorci, G., An experimental manipulation of lifehistory trajectories and resistance to oxidative stress (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 1913-1924; Auer, S.K., Arendt, J.D., Chandramouli, R., Reznick, D.N., Juvenile compensatory growth has negative consequences for reproduction in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (2010) Ecology Letters, 13, pp. 998-1007; Barrett, E.L.B., Hunt, J., Moore, A.J., Moore, P.J., Separate and combined effects of nutrition during juvenile and sexual development on female life-history trajectories: The thrifty phenotype in a cockroach (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, pp. 3257-3264; Bashey, F., Cross-generational environmental effects and the evolution of offspring size in the Trinidadian guppy Poecilia reticulata (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 348-361; Bateson, P., Fetal experience and good adult design (2001) International Journal of Epidemiology, 30, pp. 928-934; Bateson, P., Barker, D., Clutton-Brock, T., Deb, D., D'Udine, B., Foley, R.A., Gluckman, P., Developmental plasticity and human health (2004) Nature, 430, pp. 419-421; Beckerman, A., Benton, T.G., Ranta, E., Kaitala, V., Lundberg, P., Population dynamic consequences of delayed life-history effects (2002) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 17, pp. 263-269; Benton, T.G., Plaistow, S.J., Coulson, T.N., Complex population dynamics and complex causation: Devils, details and demography (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 1173-1181; Blount, J.D., Metcalfe, N.B., Arnold, K.E., Surai, P.F., Monaghan, P., Effects of neonatal nutrition on adult reproduction in a passerine bird (2006) Ibis, 148, pp. 509-514; Bolker, B.M., Brooks, M.E., Clark, C.J., Geange, S.W., Poulsen, J.R., Stevens, M.H.H., White, J.S.S., Generalized linear mixed models: A practical guide for ecology and evolution (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 127-135; Bronikowski, A.M., Clark, M.E., Rodd, F.H., Reznick, D.N., Population-dynamic consequences of predator-induced life history variation in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2194-2204; Costantini, D., Oxidative stress in ecology and evolution: Lessons from avian studies (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 1238-1251; De Block, M., Stoks, R., Fitness effects from egg to reproduction: Bridging the life history transition (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 185-197; Compensatory growth and oxidative stress in a damselfly (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 275, pp. 781-785; Dmitriew, C.M., The evolution of growth trajectories: What limits growth rate?

Despite this general belief, little theoretical basis exists for distinguishing between the types of interactions that promote diversification and those types that have no effect or that even restrict it. Using analytical models and simulations of phenotypic evolution across a metapopulation, we show that coevolutionary interactions promote diversification when they impose a cost of phenotype matching, as is the case for competition or host-parasite antagonism. In contrast, classical coevolutionary arms races have no tendency to promote or inhibit diversification, and mutualistic interactions actually restrict diversification. Together with the results of recent phylogenetic and ecological studies, these results suggest that the causes of diversification in many coevolutionary systems may require reassessment. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Arms race; Coevolution; Diversification; Mutualism; Parasitehost interaction; Spatial structure","antagonism; arms race; host-parasite interaction; metapopulation; mutualism; phylogenetics; spatial analysis",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Salminen, J.-P., Fishbein, M., Phylogenetic trends in phenolic metabolism of milkweeds (Asclepias): Evidence for escalation (2009) Evolution, 63, pp. 663-673; Anderson, B., Johnson, S.D., The geographical mosaic of coevolution in a plant-pollinator mutualism (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 220-225; Armbruster, W., Muchhala, N., Associations between floral specialization and species diversity: Cause, effect, or correlation?

To this end, a large number of experimental analyses have been undertaken; however, the emergent patterns between growth rate and its components are often contradictory. We believe that these conflicting results are a consequence of the way growth is measured. Growth is typically characterized by relative growth rate (RGR); however, RGR often declines as organisms get larger, making it difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome this problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed-effects models so that RGR can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily implemented methods for doing this. We then present new methods for analyzing the traditional components of RGR that explicitly allow for the fact that log (RGR) is the sum of its components. These methods provide an exact decomposition of the variance in log (RGR). Finally, we use simple analytical and simulation approaches to explore the effect of size variation on growth and its components and show that the relative importance of the components of RGR is influenced by the extent to which analyses standardize for plant size. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Growth analysis; Nonlinear mixed models; Relative growth rate; Variance decomposition","decomposition; experimental study; growth rate; nonlinearity; partitioning; plant; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,"Blackman, V.H., The compound interest law and plant growth (1919) Annals of Botany, 33, pp. 353-360; Brown, D., Alexander, N.D.E., Marrs, R.W., Albon, S., Structured accounting of the variance of demographic change (1993) Journal of Animal Ecology, 62, pp. 490-502; Coleman, J.S., McConnaughay, K.D.M., Ackerly, D.D., Interpreting phenotypic variation in plants (1994) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 9, pp. 187-191; Dijkstra, P., Lambers, H., Analysis of specific leaf area and photosynthesis of 2 inbred lines of Plantago major differing in relative growth rate (1989) New Phytologist, 113, pp. 283-290; Evans, G.C., (1972) The Quantitative Analysis of Plant Growth, , Blackwell Scientific, Oxford; Galmes, J., Cifre, J., Medrano, H., Flexas, J., Modulation of relative growth rate and its components by water stress in Mediterranean species with different growth forms (2005) Oecologia (Berlin), 145, pp. 21-31; Grime, J.P., (2002) Plant Strategies, Vegetation Processes, and Ecosystem Properties, , Chichester Wiley; Grubb, P.J., Lee, W.G., Kollmann, J., Wilson, J.B., Interaction of irradiance and soil nutrient supply on growth of seedlings of ten European tall-shrub species and Fagus sylvatica (1996) Journal of Ecology, 84, pp. 827-840; Horvitz, C., D.W.

Competition through interspecific pollen transfer may select for specialization through costs to male fitness (pollen lost to heterospecific flowers) or female fitness (heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas). Previous theoretical treatments of pollination focused solely on seed set, thus overlooking male fitness. Here we use individual-based models that explicitly track pollen fates to explore how competition affects the evolution of specialization. Results show that plants specialize on different pollinators when visit rates are high enough to remove most pollen from anthers; this increases male fitness by minimizing pollen loss to foreign flowers. At low visitation, plants generalize, which minimizes pollen left undispersed in anthers. A model variant in which plants can also evolve differences in sex allocation (pollen/ovule production) produces similar patterns of specialization. At low visitation, plants generalize and allocate more to female function. At high visitation, plants specialize and allocate equally to both sexes (in line with sex-allocation theory). This study demonstrates that floral specialization can be driven by selection through male function alone and more generally highlights the importance of community context in the ecology and evolution of pollination systems. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Community context; Competition through heterospecific pollen transfer; Generalization; Simulation model","angiosperm; competition (ecology); fitness; plant-pollinator interaction; pollinator; sex allocation; specialization",,,,,,"Aigner, P.A., Optimality modeling and fitness trade-offs: When should plants become pollinator specialists?

Box 94248, 1090 GE Amsterdam, Netherlands","Nutrient limitation determines the primary production and species composition of many ecosystems. Here we apply an adaptive dynamics approach to investigate evolution of the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers and its implications for plantherbivore interactions. The model predicts a trade-off between the competitive ability and grazing susceptibility of primary producers, driven by changes in their nutrient uptake rates. High nutrient uptake rates enhance the competitiveness of primary producers but also increase their nutritional quality for herbivores. This trade-off enables coexistence of nutrient exploiters and grazing avoiders. If herbivores are not selective, evolution favors runaway selection toward high nutrient uptake rates of the primary producers. However, if herbivores select nutritious food, the model predicts an evolutionarily stable strategy with lower nutrient uptake rates. When the model is parameterized for phytoplankton and zooplankton, the evolutionary dynamics result in plant-herbivore oscillations at ecological timescales, especially in environments with high nutrient availability and low selectivity of the herbivores. High herbivore selectivity stabilizes the community dynamics. These model predictions show that evolution permits nonequilibrium dynamics in plant-herbivore communities and shed new light on the evolutionary forces that shape the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive dynamics; Ecological stoichiometry; Nonequilibrium dynamics; Phytoplankton; Predator-prey oscillations; Resource competition","coexistence; evolutionarily stable strategy; life history trait; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; nutrient uptake; phytoplankton; plant-herbivore interaction; predator-prey interaction; primary production; stoichiometry; timescale; trade-off; zooplankton",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Prey adaptation as a cause of predator-prey cycles (1997) Evolution, 71, pp. 1742-1750; Alizon, S., Van Baalen, M., Emergence of a convex tradeoff between transmission and virulence (2005) American Naturalist, 165, pp. E155-E167; André, J.B., Ferdy, J.B., Godelle, B., Within-host parasite dynamics, emerging trade-off, and evolution of virulence with immune system (2003) Evolution, 57, pp. 1489-1497; Armstrong, R.A., Prey species replacement along a gradient of nutrient enrichment: A graphical approach (1979) Ecology, 60, pp. 76-84; Benincà, E., Huisman, J., Heerkloss, R., Jöhnk, K.D., Branco, P., Van Nes, E.H., Scheffer, M., Ellner, S.P., Chaos in a long-term experiment with a plankton community (2008) Nature, 451, pp. 822-826; Benincà, E., Jöhnk, K.D., Heerkloss, R., Huisman, J., Coupled predator-prey oscillations in a chaotic food web (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 1367-1378; Berec, L., Křivan, V., A mechanistic model for partial preferences (2000) Theoretical Population Biology, 58, pp. 279-289; Buskey, E.J., Behavioral components of feeding selectivity of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate (1997) Protoperidinium pellucidum.

However, while evidence for such countervailing selection exists for vertebrate color ornaments (e.g., Trinidadian guppies), similar studies have yet to be reported in invertebrates. Indeed, evidence for female mate choice based on extant variation in male coloration is limited in invertebrates, and researchers have not explicitly asked whether more attractive males are also more conspicuous to predators. Here we provide evidence that more chromatic male cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) are more attractive to females but should also be more conspicuous to predators. Female P. rapae preferentially mate with more chromatic males when choosing from populations of males with naturally occurring or commensurate, experimentally induced color variation. Mathematical models of female color vision confirm that females should be able to discriminate color differences between prospective mates. Further, chromatic and luminance contrast scores from female visual system models better predicted male mating success than did measures of male color derived more directly from color spectra. Last, models of avian color vision suggest that preferred males should be more conspicuous to known avian predators. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Avian vision; Color ornament; Color vision modeling; Mate choice; Pieris rapae; Sexual selection","butterfly; color morph; eye; female behavior; mate choice; numerical model; predation risk; sexual selection; vision",,,,,,"Amy, M., Monbureau, M., Durand, C., Gomez, D., Théry, M., Leboucher, G., Female canary mate preferences: Differential use of information from two types of male-male interaction (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 971-982; Arikawa, K., Wakakuwa, M., Qiu, X.D., Kurasawa, M., Stavenga, D.G., Sexual dimorphism of short-wavelength photoreceptors in the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae crucivora (2005) Journal of Neuroscience, 25, pp. 5935-5942; Bernard, G.D., Remington, C.L., Color vision in Lycaena butterflies: Spectral tuning of receptor arrays in relation to behavioral ecology (1991) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 88, pp. 2783-2787; Bowers, M.D., Brown, I.L., Wheye, D., Bird predation as a selective agent in a butterfly population (1985) Evolution, 39, pp. 93-103; Darwin, C., The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex (1871) J.

In response to the absence of specieslevel transformations in the fossil record, Darwin argued that the fossil record was too incomplete, too biased, and too poorly known to provide strong evidence against his theory. Here, this view of the fossil record is evaluated in light of 150 years of subsequent paleontological research. Although Darwin's assessment of the completeness and resolution of fossiliferous rocks was in several ways astute, today the fossil record is much better explored, documented, andunderstood than it was in 1859. In particular, a reasonably large set of studies tracing evolutionary trajectories within species can now be brought to bear on Darwin's expectation of gradual change driven by natural selection. An unusually high-resolution sequence of stickleback-bearing strata records the transformation of this lineage via natural selection. This adaptive trajectory is qualitatively consistent with Darwin's prediction, but it occurred much more rapidly than he would have guessed: almost all of the directional change was completed within 1,000 generations. In most geological sequences, this change would be too rapid to resolve. The accumulated fossil record at more typical paleontological scales (104-106 years) reveals evolutionary changes that are rarely directional and net rates ofchange that are perhaps surprisingly slow, two findings that are in agreement with the punctuated-equilibrium model. Finally, Darwin's view of the broader history of life is reviewed briefly, with a focus on competition-mediated extinction and recent paleontological and phylogenetic attempts to assess diversity dependence in evolutionary dynamics.","Charles Darwin; Diversity dependence; Fossil record; Gradualism; Modes of evolution; Stasis",,,,,,,"Allmon, W.D., Ross, R.M., (1990) Specifying Causal Factors in Evolution: The Paleontological Contribution, pp. 1-17. , in W.D.

Darwin maintained that the origin of species and the evolution of differences between them is ultimately caused by divergent selection acting to minimize competitive interactions between initially similar individuals, populations, and species. Here, we examine the empirical support for the various claims that constitute Darwin's principle, specifically that (1) competition promotes divergent trait evolution, (2) the strength of competitively mediated divergent selection increases with increasing phenotypic similarity between competitors, (3) divergence can occur within species, and (4) competitively mediated divergence can trigger speciation. We also explore aspects that Darwin failed to consider. In particular,we describe how (1) divergence can arise from selection acting to lessen reproductive interactions, (2) divergence is fueled by the intersection of character displacement and sexual selection, and (3) phenotypic plasticity may play a key role in promoting character displacement. Generally, character displacement is well supported empirically, and it remains a vital explanation for how new species arise and diversify. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Competition; Darwin's divergence of character; Hybridization; Phenotypic plasticity; Sexual selection; Speciation",,,,,,,"Abrahamson, W.G., Eubanks, M.D., Blair, C.P., Whipple, A.V., Gall flies, inquilines, and goldenrods: A model for host-race formation and sympatric speciation (2001) American Zoologist, 41, pp. 928-938; Adams, D.C., Parallel evolution of character displacement driven by competitive selection in terrestrial salamanders (2010) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 10, p. 72; Adams, D.C., Rohlf, F.J., Ecological character displacement in Plethodon: Biomechanical differences found from a geometric morphometric study (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 97, pp. 4106-4111; Agrawal, A.A., Phenotypic plasticity in the interactions and evolution of species (2001) Science, 294, pp. 321-326; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Arthurw, The evolutionary consequences of interspecific competition (1982) Advances in Ecological Research, 12, pp. 127-187; Aubret, F., Burghardt, G.M., Maumelata, S., Bonnet, X., Bradshaw, D., Feeding preferences in 2 disjunct populations of tiger snakes, Notechis scutatus (Elapidae (2006) Behavioral Ecology, 17, pp. 716-725; Barluenga, M., Stölting, K.N., Salzburger, W., Muschick, M., Meyer, A., Sympatric speciation inNicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 719-723; Behm, J.E., Ives, A.R., Boughman, J.W., Breakdown in postmating isolation and the collapse of a species pair through hybridization (2010) American Naturalist, 175, pp. 11-26; Benkman, C.W., Are the ratios of bill crossing morphs in crossbills the result of frequency-dependent selection?

Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, United States","As reflected in the title of his masterwork On the Origin of Species, Darwin proposed that adaptation is the primary mechanism of speciation. On this, Darwin was criticized for his neglect of reproductive isolation, his lack of appreciation for the role of geographic barriers, his failure to distinguish varieties from species, and his typological species concept. Two developments since Darwin, the biological species concept of Ernst Mayr and the methods of Coyne and Orr for estimating the contribution of different barriers to the total reproductive isolation, provide a framework for reconciling Darwin's view on the primacy of adaptation in speciation with later proposals that emphasize reproductive isolation. A review of the few studies that have estimated the contributions of multiple isolating barriers suggests that habitat isolation and other barriers that operate before hybrid formation are much stronger than intrinsic postzygotic isolation. In light of these data, I suggest that Darwin's focus on adaptation in the origin of species was essentially correct, a conclusion that calls for future studies that explore the links between adaptation and speciation, in particular, ecogeographic isolating barriers that result from adaptive divergence in habitat use. The recent revival in thinking about ecological factors and adaptive divergence in the origin of species echoes Darwin's muchicriticized ""principle of divergence"" and suggests that the emerging views from today's naturalists are not so different from those espoused by Darwin some 150 years ago. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptation; Darwin; Isolating barriers; Reproductive isolation; Speciation",,,,,,,"Allen, A.P., Gillooly, J.F., Savage, V.M., Brown, J.H., Kinetic effects of temperature on rates of genetic divergence and speciation (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 103, pp. 9130-9135; Angert, A.L., Growth and leaf physiology of monkeyflowers with different altitude ranges (2006) Oecologia (Berlin, 148, pp. 183-194; Angert, A.L., Schemske, D.W., The evolution of species' distributions: Reciprocal transplants across the elevation ranges of Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii (2005) Evolution, 59, pp. 1671-1684; Angert, A.L., Bradshaw Jr., H.D., Schemske, D.W., Using experimental evolution to investigate geographic range limits in monkeyflowers (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 2660-2675; Barraclough, T.G., Vogler, A.P., Detecting the geographical pattern of speciation from speciesilevel phylogenies (2000) American Naturalist, 155, pp. 419-434; Barton, N.H., Bengtsson, B.O., The barrier to genetic exchange between hybridizing populations (1986) Heredity, 56, pp. 357-376; Beardsley, P.M., Yen, A., Olmstead, R.G., AFLP phylogeny of Mimulus section Erythranthe and the evolution of hummingbird pollination (2003) Evolution, 57, pp. 1397-1410; Bolnick, D.I., Near, T.J., Tempo of postizygotic reproductive isolation in sunfishes (Teleostei: Centrarchidae (2005) Evolution, 59, pp. 1754-1767; Bouck, A.S., Wessler, R., Arnold, M.L., QTL analysis of floral traits in Louisiana iris hybrids (2007) Evolution, 61, pp. 2308-2319; Bradshaw Jr., H.D., Schemske, D.W., Allele substitution at a flower colour locus produces a pollinator shift in monkeyflowers (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 176-178; Bradshaw Jr., H.D., Wilbert, S.M., Otto, K.G., Schemske, D.W., Genetic mapping of floral traits associated with reproductive isolation in monkeyflowers (1995) Nature, 376, pp. 762-765; Bradshaw Jr., H.D., Otto, K.G., Frewen, B.E., McKay, J.K., Schemske, D.W., Quantitative trait loci affecting differences in floral morphology between two species of monkeyflower (Mimulus (1998) Genetics, 149, pp. 367-382; Browne, J., Darwin's botanical arithmetic and the ""principle of Divergence,"" 1854- 1858 (1980) Journal of the History of Biology, 13, pp. 53-89; Burger, W.C., The species concept in Quercus (1975) Taxon, 24, pp. 45-50; Christie, P., MacNair, M.R., The distribution of postmating reproductive isolating genes in populations of the yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus (1987) Evolution, 41, pp. 571-578; Counterman, B.A., Noor, M.A.F., Multilocus test for introgression between the cactophilic species Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila arizonae (2006) American Naturalist, 168, pp. 682-696; Coyne, J.A., Genetics and speciation (1992) Nature, 355, pp. 511-515; Coyne, J.A., Orr, H.A., Patterns of speciation in Drosophila (1989) Evolution, 43, pp. 362-381; Patterns of speciation in Drosophila'' revisited (1997) Evolution, 51, pp. 295-303; (2004) Speciation, , Sinauer, Sunderland, MA; Cracraft, J., (1989) Speciation and Its Ontology: The Empirical Consequences of Alternative Species Concepts for Understanding Patterns and Processes of Differentiation, , Pages 28-59 in D.

Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed 13×13 matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even 7×7, 5×5, 4×4, and 3×3 matrices and (ii) into 5×5 matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original- and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Collapsing; Comparative plant demography; Elasticity; Matrix dimension; Population growth rate (l); Projection matrix models","comparative study; demography; elasticity; growth rate; herb; life table; matrix",,,,,,"Angert, A.L., Demography of central and marginal populations of monkeyflowers (Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii) (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 2014-2025; Bierzychudek, P., Looking backwards: Assessing the projections of a transition matrix model (1999) Ecological Applications, 9, pp. 1278-1287; Bruna, E.M., Oli, M.K., Demographic effects of habitat fragmentation on a tropical herb: Life-table response experiments (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1816-1824; Bruna, E.M., Fiske, I.J., Trager, M.D., Habitat fragmentation and plant populations is what we know demographically irrelevant?

Such variation can have considerable ecological consequences, yet physiological mechanisms remain unclear. We tested the influence of somatic growth dilution (SGD) on multiple element concentrations under different bioenergetic conditions. SGD occurs when rapid individual growth causes a disproportional gain in biomass relative to gain of a specific element. SGD can strongly affect elements in various organisms, but we lack a general framework to unify results across studies and assess its overall importance.We derived the general conditions that trigger SGD from an element accumulation model. We parameterized the model with bioenergetic and element-specific rates summarized from the literature to compare SGD effects on 15 elements (nonessential metals, essential trace elements, macronutrients) in three aquatic invertebrate taxa. For all taxa, we found that SGD (1) occurs to some degree for all 15 elements over realistic ranges of growth and ingestion rates and (2) has the greatest effect on elements with low efflux (excretion) rates, including certain nonessential metals (e.g., MeHg, Po), essential trace elements, and macronutrients (e.g., N, Fe). Thus, SGD can strongly affect concentrations of a spectrum of elements under natural conditions. These results provide a framework for predicting variation in the elemental composition of animals. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bioaccumulation; Daphnia; Ecological stoichiometry; Heavy metal; Trace element; Trophic transfer","bioaccumulation; bioenergetics; biomass; crustacean; dilution; heavy metal; ingestion rate; invertebrate; physiological response; stoichiometry; trace element",,,,,,"Toxicological profile for mercury (update) (1999) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Environmental Protection Agency, , ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry), Atlanta; Amiard, J.C., Berthet, B., Fluctuations of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc concentrations in field populations of the Pacific oyster (1996) Crassostrea gigas in the Bay of Bourgneuf (Atlantic coast, France), 72, pp. 195-207. , Annales de l'Institut Oceanographique; Amiard, J.C., Amiardtriquet, C., Berthet, B., Metayer, C., (1986) Contribution to the Ecotoxicological Study of Cadmium, Lead, Copper and Zinc in the Mussel, 90, pp. 425-431. , Mytilus edulis. 1.

Fishing disproportionately removes larger, predatory fishes from marine food webs. Most studies of the consequent indirect effects focus on density-mediated interactions where predator removal alternately drives increases and decreases in abundances of successively lower trophic-level species. While prey may increase in number with fewer predators, they may also alter their behavior. When such behavioral responses impact the food resources of prey species, behaviorally mediated trophic cascades can dramatically shape landscapes. It remains unclear whether this pathway of change is typically triggered by ocean fishing. By coupling a simple foraging model with empirical observations from coral reefs, we provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and predicting how predator harvest can alter the landscape of risk for herbivores and consequently drive dramatic changes in primary producer distributions. These results broaden trophic cascade predictions for fisheries to include behavioral changes. They also provide a framework for detecting the presence and magnitude of behaviorally mediated cascades.

As brains are costly, we predict brain size to be relatively small in species that experience a higher degree of seasonality (expensive brain framework). Alternatively, it has been argued that larger brains give animals the behavioral flexibility to buffer the effects of habitat seasonality (cognitive buffer hypothesis). Here, we test these two hypotheses in a comparative study on strepsirrhine primates (African lorises and Malagasy lemurs) that experience widely varying degrees of seasonality. We found that experienced seasonality is negatively correlated with relative brain size in both groups, controlling for the effect of phylogenetic relationships and possible confounding variables such as the extent of folivory. However, relatively largerbrained lemur species tend to experience less variation in their dietary intake than indicated by the seasonality of their habitat. In conclusion, we found clear support for the hypothesis that seasonality restricts brain size in strepsirrhines as predicted by the expensive brain framework and weak support for the cognitive buffer hypothesis in lemurs. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Energetic constraints; Lemuriformes; Lorisiformes; Periodic food shortage; Phylogenetic comparative method","brain; comparative study; hypothesis testing; phylogenetics; primate; seasonal variation; seasonality",,,,,,"Aiello, L.C., Wheeler, P., The expensive-tissue hypothesis: The brain and the digestive-system in human and primate evolution (1995) Current Anthropology, 36, pp. 199-221; Akaike, H., A new look at statistical-model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Albrecht, G.H., Jenkins, P.D., Godfrey, L.R., Ecogeographic size variation among the living and subfossil prosimians of Madagascar (1990) American Journal of Primatology, 22, pp. 1-50; Allmann, J., McLaughlin, T., Hakeem, A., Brain-weight and life-span in primate species (1993) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 90, pp. 118-122; Arnold, C., Matthews, L.J., Nunn, C.L., The 10k Trees website: A new online resource for primate phylogeny (2010) Evolutionary Anthropology, 19, pp. 114-118; Barrickman, N.L., Lin, M.J., Encephalization, expensive tissues, and energetics: An examination of the relative costs of brain size in strepsirrhines (2010) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, , doi:10.1002/ajpa.21354; Batschelet, E., (1981) Circular Statistics in Biology, , Academic Press, London; Beattie, J.C., Feistner, A.T.C., Adams, N.M.O., Barker, P., Carroll, J.B., First captive breeding of the aye-aye, Daubentonia madagascariensis (1992) Dodo, 28, pp. 23-30; Bininda-Emonds, O.R.P., Cardillo, M., Jones, K.E., MacPhee, R.D.E., Beck, R.M.D., Grenyer, R., Price, S.A., The delayed rise of present-day mammals (2007) Nature, 446, pp. 507-512; Boisvenue, C., Running, S.W., Impacts of climate change on natural forest productivity: Evidence since the middle of the 20th century (2006) Global Change Biology, 12, pp. 862-882; Catlett, K.K., Schwartz, G.T., Godfrey, L.R., Jungers, W.L., Life history space: A multivariate analysis of life history variation in extant and extinct Malagasy lemurs (2010) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 143, pp. 391-404; Charles-Dominique, P., Ecology and feeding behavior of five sympatric lorisids in Gabon (1974) Prosimian Biology, pp. 131-150. , in R.

Box 3020, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","Functional responses play a central role in the nature and stability of predator-prey population dynamics. Here we investigate how induced defenses affect predator functional responses. In experimental communities, prey (Paramecium) expressed two previously undocumented inducible defenses-a speed reduction and a width increase-in response to nonlethal exposure to predatory Stenostomum. Nonlethal exposure also changed the shape of the predator's functional response from Type II to Type III, consistent with changes in the density dependence of attack rates. Handling times were also affected by prey defenses, increasing at least sixfold. These changes show that induced changes in prey have a real defensive function. At low prey densities, induction led to lower attack success; at high prey densities, attack rates were actually higher for induced prey. However, induction increased handling times sufficiently that consumption rates of defended prey were lower than those of undefended prey. Modification of attack rate and handling time has important potential consequences for population dynamics; Type III functional responses can increase the stability of population dynamics and persistence because predation on small populations is low, allowing a relict population to survive. Simulations of a predator-prey population dynamic model revealed the stabilizing potential of the Type III response. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Functional responses; Inducible defenses; Predator-prey interactions","ciliate; density dependence; flatworm; functional response; predator-prey interaction; prey selection",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Functional responses of optimal foragers (1982) American Naturalist, 120, pp. 382-390; Altwegg, R., Eng, M., Caspersen, S., Anholt, B.R., Functional response and prey defence level in an experimental predator-prey system (2006) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 8, pp. 115-128; Anholt, B.R., Ludwig, D., Rasmussen, J.B., Optimal pursuit times: How long should predators pursue their prey?

However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the monoculture treatment, indicating that direct effects were offset by strong indirect effects on the evolution of traits. For most of the traits measured, indirect effects were opposed to, and often stronger than, direct effects. These indirect effects occurred as a result of behavioral changes of the predator in the presence of competitors and as a result of reduced densities of competitors in the presence of predators. Incorporating indirect effects provides a more realistic description of how species evolve in complex natural communities. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Colpoda; Competition; Predation; Protozoa; Sarracenia purpurea; Selection","abundance; ciliate; coexistence; evolutionarily stable strategy; growth rate; inquilinism; larva; life history trait; mosquito; sexual selection; species diversity",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Predators that benefit prey and prey that harm predators: Unusual effects of interacting foraging adaptation (1992) American Naturalist, 140, pp. 573-600; Alatalo, R.V., Mappes, J., Tracking the evolution of warning signals (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 708-710; Astles, P.A., Moore, A.J., Preziosi, R.F., Genetic variation in response to an indirect ecological effect (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 272, pp. 2577-2581; Blaustein, L., Non-consumptive effects of larval Salamandra on crustacean prey: Can eggs detect predators?

Much has been learned about the development, genetics, and evolution of wing eyespot patterns and about how seasonal polyphenism in this species provides an adaptive response to the wet-dry environments it inhabits. Recent work is also examining the role of male secondary sexual traits, the wing scent brushes, and associated sex pheromones in mate choice and sexual selection. However, B. anynana is but one member of a spectacular radiation amounting to some 250 extant species in the subtribe Mycalesina in the Old World tropics. Therefore, it is appropriate timing to consider whether the experimental work on a single species can help in analyzing pattern and process in the spectacular expansion of this whole clade of mycalesine butterflies. The most recent molecular phylogenetics (Kodandaramaiah et al. 2010) underpins the occurrence of several parallel geographical radiations on the African mainland, on Madagascar, and in Asia. Expansions of the mycalesine butterflies into more seasonal environments may have occurred in tandem with those of their larval host plants, the grasses, around 25 million years ago. This article examines how the findings from multidisciplinary work on B. anynana could be the basis for a comparative approach to unravel the processes of adaptation and speciation that have yielded patterns of occupancy of trait space in the mycalesines. The parallel nature of radiations in at leastthree geographical regions provides exceptional power for such an analysis. I argue that research on B. anynana has provided an invaluable backbone for such an endeavor by revealing candidate suites of traits involved in adaptation to new ecological opportunities and in the evolution of reproductive isolation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bicyclus; Evo-devo; Eyespot; Grasses; Pheromone; Polyphenism",,,,,,,"Abzhanov, A., Protas, M., Grant, B.R., Grant, P.R., Tabin, C.J., Bmp4 and morphological variation of beaks in Darwin's finches (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1462-1465; Abzhanov, A., Kuo, W.P., Hartmann, C., Grant, B.R., Grant, P.R., Tabin, C.J., The calmodulin pathway and evolution of elongated beak morphology in Darwin's finches (2006) Nature, 442, pp. 563-567; Allen, C., Beldade, P., Zwaan, B.J., Brakefield, P.M., Differences in the selection response of serially repeated color pattern characters: Standing variation, development, and evolution (2008) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8, p. 94. , doi:10.1186/1471-2148-8-94; Barbehenn, R.V., Bernays, E.A., Relative nutritional quality of C3 and C4 grasses for a graminivorous lepidopteran, Paratrytone melane (Hesperiidae (1992) Oecologia (Berlin, 92, pp. 97-103; Beldade, P., Brakefield, P.M., The genetics and evo-devo of butterfly wing patterns (2002) Nature Review Genetics, 3, pp. 442-452; Beldade, P., Koops, K., Brakefield, P.M., Developmental constraints versus flexibility in morphological evolution (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 844-847; Modularity, individuality, and evo-devo in butterfly wings (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 99, pp. 14262-14267; Bell, M.A., Foster, S.A., (1994) The Evolutionary Biology of the Threespine Stickleback, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Benedick, S., White, T.A., Searle, J.B., Hamer, K.C., Mustaffa, N., Khen, C.V., Mohamed, M., Hill, J.K., Impacts of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity in a tropical forest butterfly on Borneo (2007) Journal of Tropical Ecology, 23, pp. 623-634; Braby, M.F., Phenotypic variation in adult Mycalesis Hübner (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) from the Australian wetdry tropics (1994) Australian Journal of Entomology, 33, pp. 327-336; Brakefield, P.M., The evolution-development interface and advances with the eyespot patterns of Bicyclus butterflies (1998) Heredity, 80, pp. 265-272; Evo-devo and constraints on selection (2006) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21, pp. 362-368; Brakefield, P.M., Frankino, W.A., (2009) Polyphenisms in Lepidoptera: Multidisciplinary Approaches to Studies of Evolution, pp. 121-151. , in D.

The complaint focuses in particular on Darwin's supposed failure to explain the evolution of the sterility and inviability of interspecific hybrids. But in his chapter on hybridism, Darwin, working without genetics, got as close to the modern understanding of the evolution of hybrid sterility and inviabilityas might reasonably be expected. In particular, after surveying whatwas then known about interspecific crosses and the resulting hybrids, he established two facts that, while now taken for granted, were at the time radical. First, the sterility barriers between species are neither specially endowed by a creator nor directly favored by natural selection but rather evolve as incidental by-products of interspecific divergence. Second, the sterility of species hybrids results when their development is ""disturbed by two organizations having been compounded into one."" Bateson, Dobzhansky, and Muller later put Mendelian detail to Darwin's inference that the species-specific factors controlling development (i.e., genes) are sometimes incompatible. In this article, I highlight the major developments in our understanding of these interspecific genetic incompatibilities-from Darwin toMuller to modern theory-and review comparative, genetic, and molecular rules that characterize the evolution of hybrid sterility and inviability. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Darwin; Hybrid incompatibility; Postzygotic isolation; Speciation",,,,,,,"Bachtrog, D., Thornton, K., Clark, A.G., Andolfatto, P., Extensive introgression of mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear genes in the Drosophila yakuba species group (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 292-302; Barbash, D.A., Roote, J., Ashburner, M., The Drosophila melanogaster hybrid male rescue gene causes inviability in male and female species hybrids (2000) Genetics, 154, pp. 1747-1771; Barbash, D.A., Siino, D.F., Tarone, A.M., Roote, J., A rapidly evolving MYB-related protein causes species isolation in Drosophila (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, pp. 5302-5307; Barton, N.H., Hewitt, G.M., Analysis of hybrid zones (1985) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 16, pp. 113-148; Bateson, W., (1909) Heredity and Variation in Modern Lights, , Pages 85-101 in A.C.

Drawing on the analytic derivation of equilibria numerical simulations and graphical assessments I provide conditions under which sympatry parapatry or regional exclusion is expected during different phases of the community's development. I also demonstrate that specific competitive asymmetries produce distinguishable distributions and invasion patterns and identify which populations are found centrally or peripherally. Dynamic and dispersal equilibria were examined for differences in the sensitivity to spatial variations in fitness per capita mortality metabolic efficiency the strength of interspecific interference resource collection speed and the optimal location of each population along an environmental cline. These asymmetries were studied both in isolation and pairwise in fitness trade-off scenarios. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Density-dependent fitness; Fitness trade-off; Ideal directed movement;

Helminth infection can bias the host immune response toward a T-helper type 2 (Th2) over a type 1 (Th1) response impairing the host's ability to control concurrent intracellular microparasite infections and potentially modifying disease dynamics. In humans immune-mediated interactions between helminths and microparasites can alter host susceptibility to diseases such as HIV tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. However the extent to which similar processes operate in natural animal populations and influence disease spread remains unknown.We used cross-sectional experimental and genetic studies to show that gastrointestinal nematode infection alters immunity to intracellular microparasites in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Buffalo that were more resistant to nematode infection had weaker Th1 responses there was significant genotypic variation in nematode resistance and anthelminthic treatment enhanced Th1 immunity. Using a disease dynamic model parameterized with empirical data we found that nematode-induced immune suppression can facilitate the invasion of bovine TB in buffalo. In the absence of nematodes TB failed to invade the system illustrating the critical role nematodes may play in disease establishment. Our results suggest that helminths by influencing the likelihood of microparasite invasion may influence patterns of disease emergence in the wild. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Disease emergence; Genetic resistance; Immunity; Nematode; Syncerus caffer; Tuberculosis","cattle; disease spread; disease treatment; gastroenteritis; genetic analysis; genotype; host-parasite interaction; human immunodeficiency virus; immune response; immune system; infectious disease; nematode; numerical model; parasitic disease; tuberculosis; wild population",,,,,,"Abbas, A.K., Murphy, K.M., Sher, A., Functional diversity of helper T lymphocytes (1996) Nature, 383, pp. 787-793; Abu-Raddad, L.J., Patnaik, P., Kublin, J.G., Dual infection with HIV and malaria fuels the spread of both diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (2006) Science, 314, pp. 1603-1606; Ayash-Rashkovsky, M., Chenine, A.L., Steele, L.N., Lee, S.J., Song, R.J., Ong, H., Rasmussen, R.A., Abhishek, S., Coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni reactivates viremia in rhesus macaques with chronic simian-human immunodeficiency virus clade C infection (2007) Infection and Immunity, 75, pp. 1751-1756; Bengis, R.G., (1999) Tuberculosis: Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine, , Saunders, Philadelphia; Bentwich, Z., Kalinkovich, A., Weisman, Z., Borkow, G., Beyers, N., Beyers, A.D., Can eradication of helminthic infections change the face of AIDS and tuberculosis?

Given such virulence hosts should evolve strategies to resist or tolerate infection. But what governs those strategies and the costs that they incur? This study illustrates how a fecundity-susceptibility trade-off among clonally reared genotypes of a zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) infected by a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) arises due to variation in resource acquisition and use by hosts. To make these connections we used lab experiments and theoretical models that link feeding with susceptibility energetics and fecundity of hosts. These feeding-based mechanisms also produced a fecundity-survivorship trade-off. Meanwhile a parasite spore yield-fecundity trade-off arose from variation in juvenile growth rate among host clones (another index of resource use) a result that was readily anticipated and explained by the models.

They argue that dominant females concede reproductive opportunities to subordinates to retain them in the group or to dissuade them from challenging for the dominant position or that subordinate females breed where dominants are incapable of controlling them. However an alternative possibility is that suppressing subordinate reproduction has substantive costs to the fitness of dominant females and that variation in these costs generates differences in the net benefits of suppression to dominants which are responsible for variation in the frequency of subordinate breeding that is not a consequence of either reproductive concessions or limitations in dominant control. Here we show that in wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the frequency with which dominants evict subordinates or kill their pups varies with the costs and benefits to dominants of suppressing subordinate breeding including the dominants' reproductive status the size of their group and the relatedness of subordinates. We review evidence from other studies that the suppression of reproduction by subordinates varies with the likely costs of subordinate breeding to dominants. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Cooperation; Mammals; Reproduction; Reproductive skew; Suppression","adaptive radiation; dominance; fitness; frequency analysis; mammal; relatedness; reproduction; reproductive behavior; reproductive cost; small mammal",,,,,,"Bertram, B.C.R., Social factors influencing reproduction in wild lions (1975) Journal of Zoology, 177, pp. 463-482; Cant, M.A., A model for the evolution of reproductive skew without reproductive suppression (1998) Animal Behaviour, 55, pp. 163-169; Cant, M.A., Social control of reproduction in banded mongooses (2000) Animal Behaviour, 59, pp. 147-158; Cant, M.A., Johnstone, R.A., Costly young and reproductive skew in animal societies (1999) Behavioral Ecology, 10, pp. 178-184; Cant, M.A., Hodge, S.J., Gilchrist, J.S., Bell, M.B.V., Nichols, H.J., Reproductive control via eviction (but not the threat of eviction) in banded mongooses (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 277, pp. 2219-2226; Chapais, B., Kinship, competence, and cooperation in primates (2006) Cooperation in Primates and Humans: Mechanisms and Evolution, pp. 47-64. , P.

The disparity between experiment and theory is partially due to the high dimensionality of models that include both evolutionary and ecological dynamics. Here we show how the theory of fast-slow dynamical systems can be used to reduce model dimension, and we use that body of theory to study a general predator-prey system exhibiting fast evolution in either the predator or the prey. Our approach yields graphical methods with predictive power about when new and unique dynamics (e.g., completely out-of-phase oscillations and cryptic dynamics) can arise in ecological systems exhibiting fast evolution. In addition, we derive analytical expressions for determining when such behavior arises and how evolution affects qualitative properties of the ecological dynamics. Finally, while the theory requires a separation of timescales between the ecological and evolutionary processes, our approach yields insight into systems where the rates of those processes are comparable and thus is a step toward creating a general ecoevolutionary theory. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Coevolution; Ecoevolutionary dynamics; Fast-slow dynamics; Predator-prey","abundance; bioaccumulation; coevolution; numerical model; predator-prey interaction; qualitative analysis; spatial distribution; timescale",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Adaptive foraging by predators as a cause of predator-prey cycles (1992) Evolutionary Ecology, 6, pp. 56-72; Abrams, P.A., Modelling the adaptive dynamics of traits involved in inter- and intraspecific interactions: An assessment of three models (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 166-175; Abrams ., P.A., Adaptive Dynamics"" vs. ""adaptive dynamics (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 1162-1165; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Fitness minimization and dynamic instability as a consequence of predator-prey coevolution (1997) Evolutionary Ecology, 11, pp. 1-20; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Prey adaptation as a cause of predator-prey cycles (1997) Evolution, 51, pp. 1742-1750; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Harada, Y., Evolutionarily unstable fitness maxima and stable fitness minima of continuous traits (1993) Evolutionary Ecology, 7, pp. 465-487; Arnold, L., Jones, C.K.R.T., Mischaikow, K., Raugel, G., Geometric singular perturbation theory (1995) Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1609, pp. 44-188. , R.

In his theory intraspecific differences in resource use are not accounted for. Here we extend this theory to include situations where organisms undergo ontogenetic diet shifts as these characterize the life histories of many species. In a situation that without diet shifts would lead to neutral coexistence of consumer species we investigate whether ontogenetic diet shifts lead to niche partitioning. We analyze a model describing competition for two resources between two competitors with distinctive diets over ontogeny using copepods (showing ontogenetic diet shifts) and daphnids (not showing ontogenetic diet shifts) as appropriate representatives. We show that an ontogenetic diet shift affects the shape of the ZNGI changing it from reflecting perfectly substitutable resources to reflecting essential resources. Furthermore we show that resource supply determines population stage structure and stage-dependent resource consumption in copepods and influences the competitive outcome with daphnids. In particular we show that in itself an ontogenetic diet shift can provide a competitive advantage if the supply of the adult resource is lower than the supply of the juvenile resource but that it always causes a disadvantage if the supply of the adult resource exceeds that of the juvenile resource. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Biomass model; Coexistence; Competition; Life history; Resource use; Stage structure","biomass; coexistence; competition (ecology); crustacean; diet; intraspecific interaction; juvenile; life history; numerical model; ontogeny; resource use",,,,,,"Adrian, R., Schneider-Olt, B., Top-down effects of crustacean zooplankton on pelagic microorganisms in a mesotrophic lake (1999) Journal of Plankton Research, 21, pp. 2175-2190; Bern, L., Particle selection over a broad size range by crustacean zooplankton (1994) Freshwater Biology, 32, pp. 105-112; De Roos, A.M., Schellekens, T., Van Kooten, T., De W.K.Van, Claessen, D., Persson, L., Food-dependent growth leads to overcompensation in stage-specific biomass when mortality increases: The influence of maturation versus reproduction regulation (2007) American Naturalist, 170, pp. E59-E76; De Roos, A.M., Schellekens, T., Van Kooten, T., De W.K.Van, Claessen, D., Persson, L., Simplifying a physiologically structured population model to a stage-structured biomass model (2008) Theoretical Population Biology, 73, pp. 47-62; Gause, G.F., (1934) The Struggle for Existence, , Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore; Gillooly, J.F., Brown, J.H., West, G.B., Savage, V.M., Charnov, E.L., Effects of size and temperature on metabolic rate (2001) Science, 293, pp. 2248-2251; Grover, J.P., Holt, R.D., Disentangling resource and apparent competition: Realistic models for plant-herbivore communities (1998) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 191, pp. 353-376; Guill, C., Alternative dynamical states in stage-structured consumer populations (2009) Theoretical Population Biology, 76, pp. 168-178; Haefner, J.W., Edson, J.L., Community invasion by complex life cycles (1984) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 108, pp. 377-404; Hansen, P.J., Bjornsen, P.K., Hansen, B.W., Zooplankton grazing and growth: Scaling within the 2-2,000-mm body size range (1997) Limnology and Oceanography, 42, pp. 687-704; Holt, R.D., Grover, J., Tilman, D., Simple rules for interspecific dominance in systems with exploitative and apparent competition (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 741-771; Huisman, J., Weissing, F.J., Biodiversity of plankton by species oscillations and chaos (1999) Nature, 402, pp. 407-410; Kerfoot, W.C., Kirk, K.L., Degree of taste discrimination among suspension-feeding cladocerans and copepods: Implications for detritivory and herbivory (1991) Limnology and Oceanography, 36, pp. 1107-1123; Lehman, J.T., Ecological principles affecting community structure and secondary production by zooplankton in marine and fresh-water environments (1988) Limnology and Oceanography, 33, pp. 931-945; Leibold, M.A., A graphical model of keystone predators in food webs: Trophic regulation of abundance, incidence, and diversity patterns in communities (1996) American Naturalist, 147, pp. 784-812; Loreau, M., Ebenhoh, W., Competitive-exclusion and coexistence of species with complex life-cycles (1994) Theoretical Population Biology, 46, pp. 58-77; McCann, K., Density-dependent coexistence in fish communities (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 2957-2967; Moll, J.D., Brown, J.S., Competition and coexistence with multiple life-history stages (2008) American Naturalist, 171, pp. 839-843; Mougi, A., Nishimura, K., Coexistence of competitive species with a stage-structured life cycle (2005) Ecological Research, 20, pp. 581-589; Pacala, S.W., Tilman, D., Limiting similarity in mechanistic and spatial models of plant competition in heterogeneous environments (1994) American Naturalist, 143, pp. 222-257; Peters, R.H., (1983) The Ecological Implications of Body Size., , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Polis, G.A., Holt, R.D., Menge, B.A., Winemiller, K.O., Time, space and life history: Influences on food webs (1996) Food Webs: Integration of Patterns and Dynamics., pp. 435-460. , G.

In a two-resource system with both external nutrient inputs and recycling larger consumers (integrators"") often generate resource distributions that favor their smaller (nonintegrator"") competitors and vice versa. This occurs because recycling of integrator biomass reduces between-patch resource heterogeneity whereas recycling of nonintegrator biomass does not. Combined recycling and throughput can allow coexistence when it is not possible with either alone.With recycling the presence of an integrator also may facilitate higher biomass of a co-occurring nonintegrator. Our model provides a context where recycling can generate negative feedback between competitors that differ in size and so promote coexistence. This is opposite to the positive recycling-mediated feedback commonly expected on the basis of litter chemistry differences between competitors. Effects of recycling and homogenization on nonintegrators may also be negative in our model depending on the conformation of the system's resource supply points and the species' relative resource requirements. Our model suggests that the effects of plant size on competitive outcomes may depend critically on the degree of resource recycling found in the system and reciprocally that the effects of recycling may depend on plant size. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Clonal integration; Facilitation; Heterogeneity; Recycling; Resource competition; Spatial scale","biomass; clonal growth; coexistence; developmental biology; facilitation; heterogeneity; homogeneity; numerical model; nutrient cycling; recycling",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Wilson, W.G., Coexistence of competitors in metacommunities due to spatial variation in resource growth rates: Does R predict the outcome of competition?

While indexes of phylogenetic structure which measure how related species are in a community provide insight into the processes that shape species coexistence they fail to pinpoint the phylogenetic scales at which those processes occur. Here we explore a framework to identify the species and clades responsible for the inferred patterns of phylogenetic structure within a given community. Further we evaluate how communities that share the nonrandom representation of species from a given clade in the phylogeny are distributed across geography and environmental gradients. Using Ecuadorian hummingbird communities we found that multiple patterns of phylogenetic structure often occur within a local assemblage. We also identified four geographic regions where species from certain clades exhibit nonrandom representation: the eastern Amazonian lowlands the western dry lowlands the Andes at middle elevations and the Andes at high elevations. The environmental gradients along which changes in the local coexistence of species occurred were mainly elevation annual precipitation and seasonality in both temperature and precipitation. Finally we show how these patterns can be used to generate hypotheses about the processes that allow species coexistence. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Algorithm; Biogeography; Ecuador; Environment;

Given resource limitations in collecting data the question arises as to which species should be studied to increase the size of comparative data sets. By taking hypotheses existing data relevant to the hypotheses and a phylogeny we show that a method of phylogenetic targeting can systematically guide data collection while taking into account potentially confounding variables and competing hypotheses. Phylogenetic targeting selects potential candidates for future data collection using a flexible scoring system based on differences in pairwise comparisons. We used simulations to assess the performance of phylogenetic targeting as compared with the less systematic approach of randomly selecting species (as might occur when data have been collected without regard to phylogeny and variation in the traits of interest). The simulations revealed that phylogenetic targeting increased the statistical power to detect correlations and that power increased with the number of species in the tree even when the number of species studied was held constant. We also developed a Web-based computer program called PhyloTargeting to implement the approach (http://phylotargeting.fas.harvard.edu). © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Comparative method; Correlated evolution; Pairwise comparison; Phylogeny; Taxon sampling","comparative study; data set; database; numerical model; performance assessment; phylogenetics; phylogeny; research work; selection; taxonomy",,,,,,"Ackerly, D.D., Taxon sampling, correlated evolution, and independent contrasts (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 1480-1492; Arnold, C., (2008) Phylogenetic Targeting: A Systematic Approach and Computer Program for Targeting Research Effort in Comparative Evolutionary Biology, , Diploma thesis, University of Leipzig, Leipzig; Arnold, C., Stadler, P.F., Polynomial algorithms for the maximal pairing problem: Efficient phylogenetic targeting on arbitrary trees (2010) Algorithms for Molecular Biology, 5, p. 25; Capellini, I., McNamara, P., Preston, B.T., Nunn, C.L., Barton, R.A., Does sleep play a role in memory consolidation?

We first describe the major nonspecific physiological stress mechanisms and their ecologically relevant consequences.We next synthesize the evidence for prey physiological responses to predation risk and demonstrate that they are similar across taxa and fit well within the general stress paradigm. We then illustrate the utility of our idea by applying our understanding of the ecological consequences of stress to explain how herbivoreprey physiological antipredator responses affect ecosystem dynamics. We hypothesize that stressed herbivores should forage on plant species with higher digestible carbohydrates than should unstressed herbivores to meet heightened energy demands. Increased consumption of carbohydrate-rich plants should reduce their relative abundance in the community hence altering the quantity and quality of plant litter entering the detrital pool. We further hypothesize that stress should change the elemental composition and energy content of prey excreta egesta and carcasses that enter the detrital pool. Finally prey stress should lower energy and nutrient conversion efficiency and hence the transfer of materials and energy up the food chain which should in turn weaken the association between ecosystem productivity and food chain length. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Ecological stoichiometry;

Here I study how ideal directed movement-in which individuals travel in the direction offering the most immediate perceived improvement to their personal fitness-dictates the spatial position of two populations occupying the same relative niche and engaged in competition via interference to an individual's ability to gather resources. Drawing on the analytic derivation of equilibria numerical simulations and graphical assessments I provide conditions under which sympatry parapatry or regional exclusion is expected during different phases of the community's development. I also demonstrate that specific competitive asymmetries produce distinguishable distributions and invasion patterns and identify which populations are found centrally or peripherally. Dynamic and dispersal equilibria were examined for differences in the sensitivity to spatial variations in fitness per capita mortality metabolic efficiency the strength of interspecific interference resource collection speed and the optimal location of each population along an environmental cline. These asymmetries were studied both in isolation and pairwise in fitness trade-off scenarios. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Density-dependent fitness; Fitness trade-off; Ideal directed movement;

Methods for scaling up growth in component patches to long-term growth across heterogeneity are seldom explicitly considered. Longterm growth is sometimes considered to be a weighted average of growth rates on component diets (growth integration). However if animals integrate resources across high- and low-quality diets their long-term growth may be greater than predicted from diet-specific growth rates (resource integration). We measured biomass growth rates of seven Daphnia species exposed to different types of diel variation in algal phosphorus (P) content. Support for resource integration was found for four of the seven species which achieved near maximal growth when high-P food was available for at least 12 h. In contrast no support for resource integration was found for the other three species. These three species achieved only one-half maximal growth rate under the same conditions and could be considered growth integrators. The type of integration could be predicted from the degree of stoichiometric homeostasis. Species with weak homeostatic regulation exhibited a capacity for resource integration. Resource integrators should have an advantage in heterogeneous environments. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Daphnia; Ecological stoichiometry; Homeostasis; Phosphorus limitation; Phosphorus storage;

Given such virulence hosts should evolve strategies to resist or tolerate infection. But what governs those strategies and the costs that they incur? This study illustrates how a fecundity-susceptibility trade-off among clonally reared genotypes of a zooplankton (Daphnia dentifera) infected by a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia) arises due to variation in resource acquisition and use by hosts. To make these connections we used lab experiments and theoretical models that link feeding with susceptibility energetics and fecundity of hosts. These feeding-based mechanisms also produced a fecundity-survivorship trade-off. Meanwhile a parasite spore yield-fecundity trade-off arose from variation in juvenile growth rate among host clones (another index of resource use) a result that was readily anticipated and explained by the models. Thus several key epidemiological trade-offs stem from variation in resource acquisition and use among clones. This connection should catalyze the creation of new theory that integrates resourceand gene-based responses of hosts to disease. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Consumer-resource; Control-fecundity trade-off; Daphnia; Host-parasite; Metschnikowia; Resistance-fecundity trade-off","epidemiology; fecundity; feeding behavior; fitness; fungal disease; genotype; growth rate; host-parasite interaction; infectious disease; juvenile; numerical model; resource availability; resource use; survival; trade-off; virulence; zooplankton",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.F., Lively, C.M., Infection genetics: Gene-forgene versus matching-alleles models, and all points in between (2002) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 4, pp. 79-90; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bolker, B.M., (2008) Ecological Models and Data in R, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Boots, M., Begon, M., Trade-offs with resistance to a granulosis virus in the Indian meal moth, examined by a laboratory evolution experiment (1993) Functional Ecology, 7, pp. 528-534; Boots, M., Haraguchi, Y., The evolution of costly resistance in host-parasite systems (1999) American Naturalist, 153, pp. 359-370; Boots, M., Best, A., Miller, M.R., White, A., The role of ecological feedbacks in the evolution of host defence: What does theory tell us?

Helminth infection can bias the host immune response toward a T-helper type 2 (Th2) over a type 1 (Th1) response impairing the host's ability to control concurrent intracellular microparasite infections and potentially modifying disease dynamics. In humans immune-mediated interactions between helminths and microparasites can alter host susceptibility to diseases such as HIV tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. However the extent to which similar processes operate in natural animal populations and influence disease spread remains unknown.We used cross-sectional experimental and genetic studies to show that gastrointestinal nematode infection alters immunity to intracellular microparasites in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Buffalo that were more resistant to nematode infection had weaker Th1 responses there was significant genotypic variation in nematode resistance and anthelminthic treatment enhanced Th1 immunity. Using a disease dynamic model parameterized with empirical data we found that nematode-induced immune suppression can facilitate the invasion of bovine TB in buffalo. In the absence of nematodes TB failed to invade the system illustrating the critical role nematodes may play in disease establishment. Our results suggest that helminths by influencing the likelihood of microparasite invasion may influence patterns of disease emergence in the wild. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Disease emergence; Genetic resistance; Immunity; Nematode; Syncerus caffer; Tuberculosis","cattle; disease spread; disease treatment; gastroenteritis; genetic analysis; genotype; host-parasite interaction; human immunodeficiency virus; immune response; immune system; infectious disease; nematode; numerical model; parasitic disease; tuberculosis; wild population",,,,,,"Abbas, A.K., Murphy, K.M., Sher, A., Functional diversity of helper T lymphocytes (1996) Nature, 383, pp. 787-793; Abu-Raddad, L.J., Patnaik, P., Kublin, J.G., Dual infection with HIV and malaria fuels the spread of both diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (2006) Science, 314, pp. 1603-1606; Ayash-Rashkovsky, M., Chenine, A.L., Steele, L.N., Lee, S.J., Song, R.J., Ong, H., Rasmussen, R.A., Abhishek, S., Coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni reactivates viremia in rhesus macaques with chronic simian-human immunodeficiency virus clade C infection (2007) Infection and Immunity, 75, pp. 1751-1756; Bengis, R.G., (1999) Tuberculosis: Zoo and Wild Animal Medicine, , Saunders, Philadelphia; Bentwich, Z., Kalinkovich, A., Weisman, Z., Borkow, G., Beyers, N., Beyers, A.D., Can eradication of helminthic infections change the face of AIDS and tuberculosis?

Sexual deception is currently known only from the Orchidaceae and almost always involves pollination by male hymenoptera. An outstanding problem has been to identify the selective factors in plants that favor exploitation of mating versus feeding behaviors in pollinators. Here we show that the insectlike petal ornaments on inflorescences of the daisy Gorteria diffusa elicit copulation attempts from male bombyliid flies and that the intensity of the mating response varies across geographical floral morphotypes suggesting a continuum in reliance on feeding through mating responses for pollination. Using pollen analogues applied to a morphotype with prominent insectlike petal ornaments we demonstrate that mate-seeking male flies are severalfold more active and export significantly more pollen than females. These results suggest that selection for traits that exploit insectmating behavior can occur through the male component of plant fitness and conclusively demonstrates pollination by sexual deception in Gorteria making this the first confirmed report of sexual deception outside of the Orchidaceae. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Gorteria diffusa; Male function; Pollination; Pseudocopulation; Sensory bias; Sexual deception","copulation; exploitation; feeding behavior; fitness; floral trait; fly; herb; mimicry; morphotype; physiological response; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen; pollination; selection; sensory system",,,,,,"Aigner, P.A., Optimality modeling and fitness trade-offs: When should plants become pollinator specialists?

This metric phylogenetic community dissimilarity (PCD) can be partitioned into two components a nonphylogenetic component that reflects shared species between communities (analogous to Sørensen's similarity metric) and a phylogenetic component that reflects the evolutionary relationships among nonshared species. Therefore even if a species is not shared between two communities it will increase the similarity of the two communities if it is phylogenetically related to species in the other community. We illustrate PCD with data on fish and aquatic macrophyte communities from 59 temperate lakes. Dissimilarity between fish communities associated with environmental differences between lakes often has a phylogenetic component whereas this is not the case for macrophyte communities.With simulations we then compare PCD with two other metrics of phylogenetic community similarity PST and UniFrac. Of the three metrics PCD was best at identifying environmental drivers of community dissimilarity showing lower variability and greater statistical power. Thus PCD is a statistically powerful metric that separates the effects of environmental drivers on compositional versus phylogenetic components of community structure. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Environmental gradient; Phylogenetic beta diversity; Phylogenetic community structure; Sørensen's similarity index; Species turnover; UniFrac","community structure; environmental gradient; index method; lake; macrophyte; morphotype; numerical model; phylogenetics; relatedness; species diversity; temperate environment",,,,,,"Abouheif, E., A method for testing the assumption of phylogenetic independence in comparative data (1999) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 1, pp. 895-909; Anderson, C.L., Janßen, T., Monocots (2009) The Timetree of Life, pp. 203-212. , S.

Here I show ecological correlations between solar radiation levels and sexual dimorphism in body color of a Hawaiian damselfly. Megalagrion calliphya exhibits sexual monomorphism at high elevations where both sexes are red in color; sexual dimorphism at low elevations where females are green; and female-limited dimorphism at midelevations where both red and green females exist. Within a midelevation population red females are also more prevalent during high daily levels of solar radiation. I found that red pigmentation is correlated with superior antioxidant ability that may protect from UV damage and confer a benefit to damselflies in exposed habitats including males which defend exposed mating habitats at all elevations and females which are in shaded habitats except at high elevation. This study characterizes the ecology of sexual dimorphism and provides a new ecological hypothesis for the evolution of female-limited dimorphism. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Andromorph; Antioxidant; Color variation; Female polymorphism; Sexual conflict","antioxidant; color morph; fly; functional morphology; habitat type; pigment; polymorphism; population structure; sex-related difference; sexual conflict; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; solar radiation; ultraviolet radiation; Hawaiian Islands",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Andrés, J.A., Sánchez-Guillén, R.A., Cordero Rivera, A., Molecular evidence for selection on female color polymorphism in the damselfly Ischnura graellsii (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 2156-2161; Andrés, J.A., Sánchez-Guillén, R.A., Cordero Rivera, A., Evolution of female color polymorphism in damselflies: Testing the hypotheses (2002) Animal Behaviour, 63, pp. 677-685; Chapman, R.F., (1982) The Insects: Structure and Function, , 3rd ed.

Combating parasites requires costly immune defenses that are assumed to trade off with other life-history traits. In vertebrate males, immune defense is thought to trade off with reproductive success, as androgens enhancing sexual signaling can suppress immunity. The phenotypic relationship between male androgen levels and immune function has been addressed in many experimental studies. However, these do not provide information on either intraor intersex genetic correlations, necessary for understanding sexual and sexually antagonistic selection theories. We measured male and female humoral antibody responses to a novel antigen (bovine gamma globulin), total immunoglobulin G, and the male testosterone level of a laboratory population of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Although we studied five traits, factor-analytic modeling of the additive genetic (co)variance matrix within a restricted maximum likelihood-animal model supported genetic variation in three dimensions. Sixty-five percent of the genetic variation contrasted testosterone with both immune measures in both sexes; consequently, selection for the male trait (testosterone) will have correlated effects on the immune system not only in males but also in females. Thus, our study revealed an intra-and intersexual genetic trade-off between immunocompetence and male reproductive effort, of which only indirect evidence has existed so far. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Animal model; Genetic correlation; Handicap; Immunocompetence; Myodes glareolus; Testosterone","antibody; antigen; defense behavior; ecological modeling; experimental study; genetic variation; host-parasite interaction; immune response; intersexual interaction; intrasexual interaction; life history trait; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive effort; reproductive success; rodent; ruminant; sexual selection; signal; testosterone; three-dimensional modeling; trade-off",,,,,,"Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Blows, M.W., A tale of two matrices: Multivariate approaches in evolutionary biology (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20, pp. 1-8; Blows, M.W., Hoffmann, A.A., A reassessment of genetic limits to evolutionary change (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 1371-1384; Bondrup-Nielsen, S., Karlsson, F., Movements and spatial patterns in populations of Clethrionomys species: A review (1985) Annales Zoologici Fennici, 22, pp. 385-392; Boonekamp, J.J., Ros, A.H.F., Verhulst, S., Immune activation suppresses plasma testosterone level: A meta-analysis (2008) Biology Letters, 4, pp. 741-744; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference, , Springer, New York; Dorner, G., Eckert, R., Hinz, G., Androgen-dependent sexual dimorphism of the immune-system (1980) Endokrinologie, 76, pp. 112-114; Evans, M.R., Goldsmith, A.R., Norris, S.R., The effects of testosterone on antibody production and plumage coloration in male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) (2000) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 47, pp. 156-163; Fernald, R.D., The effect of testosterone on the behavior and coloration of adult male cichlid fish (Haplochromis burtoni, Guenther) (1976) Hormone Research, 7, pp. 172-178; Folstad, I., Karter, A.J., Parasites, bright males, and the immunocompetence handicap (1992) American Naturalist, 139, pp. 603-622; French, S.S., Denardo, D.F., Moore, M.C., Trade-offs between the reproductive and immune systems: Facultative responses to resources or obligate responses to reproduction?

Several studies argue that higher song pitch is an adaptation to reduce masking from noise, and it has even been suggested that the song divergence between urban and nonurban songs might lead to reproductive isolation. Here we present models of signal transmission to compare the benefits of raised song amplitude and song pitch in terms of sound transmission. We chose two bird species that sing with higher pitch in urban areas, the great tit (Parus major) and the blackbird (Turdus merula). For both species, we calculated communication distances in response to different levels of urban noise and in their natural forest habitats. We found that an increase in vocal pitch increased communication distance only marginally. In contrast, vocal amplitude adjustments had a strong and significantly larger effect. Our results indicate that frequency changes of urban songs are not very effective in mitigating masking from traffic noise. Increased song pitch might not be an adaptation to reduce signal masking but a physiological side effect of singing at high amplitudes or an epiphenomenon of urbanization that is not related to signal transmission. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Acoustic communication; Bird song; Parus major; Signal transmission; Traffic noise; Turdus merula","adaptive radiation; anthropogenic source; divergence; forest ecosystem; frequency analysis; habitat type; noise pollution; passerine; signal; song; species diversity; urban area; urbanization",,,,,,"Beckers, G.J.L., Suthers, R.A., Ten Cate, C., Mechanisms of frequency and amplitude modulation in ring dove song (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, 206, pp. 1833-1843; Bee, M.A., Perrill, S.A., Responses to conspecific advertisement calls in the green frog (Rana clamitans) and their role in male-male communication (1996) Behaviour, 133, pp. 283-301; Bee, M.A., Swanson, E.M., Auditory masking of anuran advertisement calls by road traffic noise (2007) Animal Behaviour, 74, pp. 1765-1776; Bermudez-Cuamatzin, E., Rios-Chelen, A.A., Gil, D., Garcia, C.M., Strategies of song adaptation to urban noise in the house finch: Syllable pitch plasticity or differential syllable use?

To assess the outcome of this process in a population of chestnut-sided warblers (Dendroica pensylvanica), we recorded songs at intervals over a 19-year period. These recordings revealed the pattern of cultural evolution of songs in our study area, from which we inferred likely learning predispositions and mechanisms of cultural transmission. We found that the species' two song categories form two distinct cultural traditions, each with its own pattern of change over time. Unaccented-ending songs have undergone continual, rapid turnover of song and element types, consistent with a model of neutral cultural evolution. Accented-ending songs, in contrast, persisted virtually unchanged for the entire study period, with extraordinarily constant song form and only one appearance of a new song type. Our results indicate that in songbirds, multiple independent cultural traditions and probably multiple independent learning predispositions can evolve concurrently, especially when different signal classes have become specialized for different communicative functions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Animal culture; Birdsong; Chestnut-sided warbler; Cultural evolution; Dendroica pensylvanica; Oscine","coevolution; deciduous tree; environmental assessment; numerical model; phenotype; record; songbird",,,,,,"Aoki, K., A sexual-selection model for the evolution of imitative learning of song in polygynous birds (1989) American Naturalist, 134, pp. 599-612; Baker, M.C., Gammon, D.E., Persistence and change of vocal signals in natural populations of chickadees: Annual sampling of the gargle call over eight seasons (2006) Behaviour, 143, pp. 1473-1509; Ballentine, B., Hyman, J., Nowicki, S., Vocal performance influences female response to male bird song: An experimental test (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 163-168; Beecher, M.D., Birdsong learning in the laboratory and field (1996) Ecology and Evolution of Acoustic Communication in Birds, pp. 61-78. , D.

That detail, generated by small-spatial-scale but often lengthy experiments, is essential to managing and even restoring ecosystems. My essay focuses primarily on the ecology of exposed rocky intertidal shores, but I believe the derived implications are generalizable to all ecosystems. A mainly experimental approach has tended to avoid a preoccupation with niches but instead has focused on the ecological roles exercised by particular species. Attention to roles has produced a growing appreciation for trophic cascades and their consequences, with obvious implications for the management of fisheries and the conservation significance of apex predators. Some studies are more phenomenological and others more reductionist in focus, but all provide pathways toward understanding abundance and body size variation or a miscellany of indirect effects. Microecology in all ecosystems should continue to prosper independently of a macroecological, predominately terrestrial perspective. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Experiment; Macroecology; Management; Niche; Phenomenology; Role","abundance; body size; community structure; conservation management; ecosystem function; ecosystem management; experimental study; fishery management; harvesting; intertidal environment; macroecology; restoration ecology; spatial analysis",,,,,,"Bertness, M.D., Callaway, R.M., Positive interactions in communities (1994) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 9, pp. 191-193; Bertness, M.D., Ewanchuk, P.J., Silliman, B.R., Anthropogenic modification of New England salt marsh landscapes (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 99, pp. 1395-1398; Birkeland, C., Interactions between a sea pen and seven of its predators (1974) Ecological Monographs, 44, pp. 211-232; Brown, J.H., (1995) Macroecology, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Brown, J.H., Davidson, D.W., Competition between seed-eating rodents and ants in desert ecosystems (1977) Science, 196, pp. 880-882; Brusca, R.C., Brusca, G.J., (2003) Invertebrates, , Sinauer, Sunderland, MA; Cain, M.L., Nathan, R., Levin, S.A., Long-distance dispersal (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 1943-1944; Carlson, H.R., Pfister, C.A., A seventeen-year study of the rose star Crossaster papposus population in a coastal bay in southeast (1999) Alaska.

Variation in incubation periods among oviparous reptiles might result from variation in either the amount of embryogenesis completed before laying or the subsequent developmental rates of embryos. Selection on incubation duration could change either of those traits. We examined embryonic development of fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus)from three populations (Indiana, Mississippi, and Florida) that occur at different latitudes and therefore experience different temperatures and season lengths. These data reveal countergradient variation: at identical temperatures in the laboratory, incubation periods were shorter for lizards from cooler areas. This variation was not related to stage at oviposition; eggs of all populations were laid at similar developmental stages. Instead, embryonic development proceeded more rapidly in cooler-climate populations, compensating for the delayed development caused by lower incubation temperatures in the field. The accelerated development appears to occur via an increase in heart mass (and, thus, stroke volume) in one population and an increase in heart rate in the other. Hence, superficially similar adaptations of embryonic developmental rate to local conditions may be generated by dissimilar proximate mechanisms. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Countergradient variation; Heart rate; Heart size; Incubation period; Metabolic rate; Sceloporus undulatus","adaptive radiation; developmental biology; developmental stage; embryonic development; functional morphology; geographical variation; hatching; laboratory method; life history trait; lizard; oviposition; population distribution; population structure; selection; temperature effect; United States",,,,,,"Angilletta, M.J., Winters, R.S., Dunham, A.E., Thermal effects on the energetics of lizard embryos: Implications for hatchling phenotypes (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 2957-2968; Angilletta, M.J., Sears, M.W., Pringle, R.M., Spatial dynamics of nesting behavior: Lizards shift microhabitats to construct nests with beneficial thermal properties (2009) Ecology, 90, pp. 2933-2939; Birchard, G.F., Deeming, D.C., Effects of incubation temperature (2004) Reptilian Incubation: Environment, Evolution and Behaviour, pp. 103-123. , D.

However, research on indirect effects has been heavily biased toward top-down trophic interactions, and less is known about other indirect-interaction pathways. As autogenic ecosystem engineers, plants can serve as initiators of nontrophic indirect interactions that, like top-down pathways, can involve both trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) and density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs). Using microcosms, I examined a plant -predator -consumer interaction pathway involving the exotic autogenic ecosystem engineer Centaurea maculosa; native Dictyna spiders (which exhibit density and trait [web-building] responses to C. maculosa); Dictyna's insect prey, Urophora affinis; and Urophora's host plant (a secondary receiver species) to quantify DMIIs and TMIIs in an autogenic engineered pathway. Both DMIIs and TMIIs were strong enough to reduce Urophora populations, but only DMIIs, which were 4.3 times stronger than TMIIs, were strong enough to also reduce Urophora s fecundity and increase the fecundity of its host plant. Prior field studies support these results, suggesting that the differences between DMIIs and TMIIs are even stronger in nature. This study illustrates that autogenic ecosystem engineers can initiate powerful indirect interactions that generally parallel predator-initiated interactions but also differ in important functional ways.","Biological control; Ecosystem engineer; Feedbacks; Indirect effects; Plant architecture; Spiders","biological control; ecosystem engineering; fecundity; herb; host plant; invasive species; life history trait; microcosm; physiological response; population density; predator-prey interaction; spider; top-down control; trophic interaction",,,,,,"Abrams, P., Menge, B.A., Mittelbach, C.G., Spiller, D., Yodzis, P., The role of indirect effects in food webs (1996) Food Webs: Integration of Patterns and Dynamics, pp. 371-395. , G.

Among these changes, increasing noise levels are specifically a problem for species relying on acoustic communication. Recent evidence suggests that some species adjust their acoustic signals to man-made noise. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur through short-term and reversible adjustments by behavioral plasticity or through long-term adaptations by evolutionary change. Using behavioral observations and playback experiments, we show that male reed buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) adjusted their songs immediately, singing at a higher minimum frequency and at a lower rate when noise levels were high. Our data showed that these changes in singing behavior were short-term adjustments of signal characteristics resulting from behavioral plasticity, rather than a long-term adaptation. However, more males remained unpaired at a noisy location than at a quiet location throughout the breeding season. Thus, phenotypic plasticity enables individuals to respond to environmental changes, but whether these short-term adjustments are beneficial remains to be seen. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Animal communication; Birdsong; Emberiza schoeniclus; Environmental change; Noise pollution; Phenotypic plasticity","adaptive radiation; anthropogenic source; behavioral ecology; breeding season; environmental change; frequency analysis; noise pollution; phenotypic plasticity; song; songbird",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Brumm, H., The impact of environmental noise on song amplitude in a territorial bird (2004) Journal of Animal Ecology, 73 (3), pp. 434-440. , DOI 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00814.x; Brumm, H., Slabbekoorn, H., Acoustic Communication in Noise (2005) Advances in the Study of Behavior, 35, pp. 151-209. , DOI 10.1016/S0065-3454(05)35004-2, PII S0065345405350042; Catchpole, C.K., Slater, P.J.B., (2008) Bird Song: Biological Themes and Variations, , 2nd ed.

We investigated whether this pattern extends to physically independent eusocial systems by measuring the metabolic rates of whole functioning colonies of the seed-harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus. These intraspecific scaling data were compared to the predictions of an additive model developed to estimate collective metabolic rates. Contrary to the prediction of the additive model, colony metabolic rate allometry resembled the pattern commonly observed interspecifically for individual organisms, scaling with colony mass<sup>0 75</sup>. Among the same-aged colonies, net growth rate varied by up to sevenfold, with larger colonies exhibiting higher net growth efficiency than smaller colonies. Isolated worker groups exhibited isometric metabolic rate scaling, suggesting that the social environment of the colony is critical to regulating individual patterns of work output. Within the social environment, individual worker locomotor velocities exhibited power-law distributions that scaled with colony size so that larger colonies exhibited a greater disparity between active and inactive ants than did smaller colonies. These results demonstrate that behavioral organization within colonies may have a major influence on colony-level metabolism and in generating intraspecific variation in growth trajectories. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Allometry; Ants; Energetics; Metabolic rate; Scaling; Sociality","allometry; ant; body size; colony; growth rate; harvesting; intraspecific variation; metabolism; numerical model; seed; social behavior",,,,,,"Alleyne, M., Chappell, M.A., Gelman, D.B., Beckage, N.E., Effects of parasitism by the braconid wasp Cotesia congregata on metabolic rate in host larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (1997) Journal of Insect Physiology, 43 (2), pp. 143-154. , DOI 10.1016/S0022-1910(96)00090-X, PII S002219109600090X; Anderson, C., Ratnieks, F., Feener Jr, D., Task partitioning in insect societies I.

In such environments, models predict a trade-off between the bet-hedging strategies dispersal and dormancy, while the increasing importance of risk reduction with decreasing predictability should lead to an increase in dispersal and dormancy along gradients of environmental predictability. However, so far there has been no experimental study to test these predictions in the field. Here, we used a set of novel field experiments that enabled us to quantify and separate seedling recruitment from three sources: local reproduction, dormancy, and dispersal. The study included the entire plant community from five environments differing considerably in predictability. Evidence for both the existence of a trade-off between dispersal and dormancy within environments and their increased use in unpredictable environments was very weak. The importance of dispersal for population and community dynamics in our system was extremely low relative to dormancy and local reproduction. This indicates that the role of dispersal for buffering environmental variation may be negligible compared with other risk-reducing strategies. Our findings highlight the urgent need for multispecies and multisite experiments in empirical tests of theoretical predictions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Annuals; Bet hedging; Dispersal; Dormancy; Trade-off; Variable environment","annual plant; dispersal; dormancy; ecological modeling; fitness; plant community; recruitment (population dynamics); reproduction; seedling; trade-off",,,,,,"Borggaard, O.K., Gimsing, A.L., Fate of glyphosate in soil and the possibility of leaching to ground and surface waters: A review (2008) Pest Management Science, 64, pp. 441-456; Cohen, D., Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment (1966) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 12, pp. 119-129; Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment when a correlation may exist between the conditions at the time a choice has to be made and the subsequent outcome (1967) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 16, pp. 1-14; Maximizing final yield when growth is limited by time or by limiting resources (1971) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 33, pp. 229-307; Cohen, D., Levin, S.A., The interaction between dispersal and dormancy strategies in varying and heterogeneous environments (1987) Lecture Notes in Biomathematics, 71, pp. 110-122; Dispersal in patchy environments: The effects of temporal and spatial structure (1991) Theoretical Population Biology, 39, pp. 63-99; Colwell, R.K., Predictability, constancy and contingency of periodic phenomena (1974) Ecology, 55, pp. 1148-1153; Duke, S.O., Powles, S.B., Glyphosate: A once-in-a- century herbicide (2008) Pest Management Science, 64, pp. 319-325; Egley, G.H., Williams, R.D., Glyphosate and paraquat effects on weed seed germination and seedling emergence (1978) Weed Science, 26, pp. 249-251; Ellner, S., Shmida, A., Why are adaptations for long-range seed dispersal rare in desert plants?

Individual heterogeneity may hide fitness costs of reproduction, but mothers could also transfer some costs to their offspring. Using data on 442 lambs weaned by 146 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) ewes at Ram Mountain, Alberta, we studied how reproductive effort varied with environmental and maternal conditions. During summer, lactating ewes should gain enough mass to survive the winter and to support their next gestation, while nursing their current lamb. We measured reproductive effort as summer mass gain by lambs corrected for maternal mass in June and maternal mass gain during summer. Females lowered their reproductive effort when population density increased and if they had weaned a lamb the previous year. A reduction in reproductive effort led to lower winter survival by lambs. Bighorn ewes have a conservative reproductive tactic and always favor their own body condition over that of their lambs. When resources are limited, ewes appear to transfer reproductive costs to their lambs, as expected from the much greater relative fitness consequences of a reduction in maternal than in offspring survival. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bighorn sheep ewe; Fitness; Heritability; Life-history traits; Parent-offspring conflict; Reproductive effort","fitness; functional morphology; heritability; heterogeneity; horn; lactation; limiting factor; parent-offspring interaction; parental investment; population density; pregnancy; reproductive cost; reproductive effort; sheep; species diversity; survival; Alberta; Canada; Ram Mountain",,,,,,"Atchley, W.R., Gaskins, C.T., Anderson, D., Statistical properties of ratios I.

The timing of segregation is determined by the pattern of crossing-over between a locus and its attached centromeres. Genes near centromeres can exploit this process by driving against spores from which the genes separated at meiosis I. Other genes, located distal to centromeres, can benefit from driving against spores from which they separated at meiosis II. Asymmetric female meiosis is particularly susceptible to such forms of drive. Selection on modifiers of recombination favors changes in the location of chiasmata that increase the proportion of tetrads of high average fitness by changing the timing of segregation. Such changes increase the frequency of driving alleles. This source of selection on recombination does not depend on effects on linkage disequilibrium. Recombinational responses to meiotic drive may contribute to sex differences in overall recombination and sex differences in the localization of chiasmata. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Centromere; Meiosis; Meiotic drive; Polar body; Recombination; Segregation","allele; fitness; frequency analysis; genetic analysis; heterozygosity; natural selection; recombination; sex-related difference",,,,,,"Agulnik, S.I., Sabantsev, I.D., Ruvinsky, A.O., Effect of sperm genotype on chromatid segregation in female mice heterozygous for aberrant chromosome. 1.

I derive explicit population-genetic models of this theory when individuals in a cohort with an arbitrary and variable number of sires and dams interact. I show that the evolution of imprinting is governed by the reciprocal of the harmonic mean number of fathers but the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean number of mothers per cohort. Thus, a few monandrous females in a polyandrous population decrease the strength of the genetic conflict and the opportunity for conflict-driven paternal imprinting. In contrast, in populations in which few males control large harems, rare males with small harems do not have such a disproportionate effect on genetic conflicts and maternal imprinting. Additionally, I demonstrate that under the conflict theory, selection for imprinted expression on paternally derived X chromosomes is much weaker than it is on maternally derived X chromosomes or autosomes. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Conflict theory; Genomic imprinting; Harem; Kin selection; Mating system; Polyandry","chromosome; cohort analysis; gene expression; genome; genomics; harem; harmonic analysis; kin selection; numerical model; polyandry; population genetics",,,,,,"Barker, M.S., Demuh, J.P., Wade, M.J., Maternal expression relaxes constraint on innovation of the anterior determinant, bicoid (2005) PLoS Genetics, 1, pp. 527-530; Bartolomei, M.S., Genomic imprinting: Employing and avoiding epigenetic processes (2009) Genes and Development, 23, pp. 2124-2133; Berger, F., Chaudhury, A., Parental memories shape seeds (2009) Trends in Plant Science, 14, pp. 550-556; Bijma, P., Muir, W.M., Ellen, E.D., Wolf, J.B., Van Arendonk, J.A.M., Multilevel selection 2: Estimating the genetic parameters determining inheritance and response to selection (2007) Genetics, 175 (1), pp. 289-299. , http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/175/1/289, DOI 10.1534/genetics.106.062729; Campos, R.L.R., Nones, K., Ledur, M.C., Moura, A., Pinto, L.F.B., Ambo, M., Boschiero, C., Quantitative trait loci associated with fatness in a broiler-layer cross (2009) Animal Genetics, 40, pp. 729-736; Crow, J.F., Kimura, M., (1970) An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory, , Harper & Row, New York; Cruickshank, T., Wade, M.J., Microevolutionary support for a developmental hourglass: Gene expression patterns shape sequence variation and divergence Drosophila (2008) Evolution and Development, 10, pp. 583-590; Day, T., Bonduriansky, R., Intralocus sexual conflict can drive the evolution of genomic imprinting (2004) Genetics, 167, pp. 1537-1546; Demuth, J.P., Wade, M.J., Maternal expression increases the rate of bicoid evolution by relaxing selective constraint (2007) Genetica, 129, pp. 37-43; Elango, N., Hunt, B.G., Goodisman, M.A.D., Yi, S.V., DNA methylation is widespread and associated with differential gene expression in castes of the honeybee, Apis mellifera (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 106, pp. 11206-11211; Gervais, M., Wilson, D.S., The evolution and functions of laughter and humor: A synthetic approach (2005) Quarterly Review of Biology, 80, pp. 395-430; Hager, R., Cheverud, J.M., Leamy, L.J., Wolf, J.B., Sex dependent imprinting effects on complex traits in mice (2008) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8, p. 9; Haig, D., Parental antagonism, relatedness asymmetries, and genomic imprinting (1997) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 264, pp. 1657-1662; Genomic imprinting, sex-biased dispersal, and social behavior (2000) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 907, pp. 149-163; Kinship asymmetries and the divided self (2008) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31, pp. 271-272; Haig, D., Wharton, R., Prader-Willi syndrome and the evolution of human childhood (2003) American Journal of Human Biology, 15, pp. 320-329; Hall, J.G., Genomic imprinting: Review and relevance to human diseases (1990) American Journal of Human Genetics, 46, pp. 857-873; Horsler, K., Oliver, C., The behavioural phenotype of Angelman syndrome (2006) Journal of Intellectual Disability Research, 50, pp. 33-53; Hurst, L.D., Is multiple paternity necessary for the evolution of genomic imprinting?

This prediction led to the hypothesis that flies with the deletion would have lower cytochrome c oxidase activity and higher levels of mRNA expression from cox7A. This result was observed, but unexpectedly, elevated levels of mRNA expression were also observed in genes encoding subunits of complexes I, III, and IV. Together these data suggest that the deletion causes a high bioenergetic cost to the organism. To investigate the predicted cost at a physiological level, we assayed aspects of adult female fitness. Starvation sensitivity but not feeding rate was significantly influenced by the two-amino acid deletion. Further, we observed that carbohydrate and protein levels but not lipid levels were higher in the mutant flies. Together, these data show that quaternary structure modeling and biochemistry can be used to link the genotype with the organismal phenotype. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Complex IV; Cox7A; mRNA expression; Mutation; Oxidative phosphorylation","amino acid; biochemistry; carbohydrate; cytochrome; ecological modeling; electron; enzyme activity; fitness; fly; gene expression; genetic analysis; genotype; homology; hypothesis testing; mutation; phenotype; protein; Quaternary; reproductive cost",,,,,,"Relative quantitation of gene expression (2001) User Bulletin, 2. , Applied Biosystems, ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system.

Motivated by the growing knowledge on the antigenic variation system of the sleeping sickness parasite, the African trypanosome, we introduce a mechanistic framework for modeling within-host infection dynamics. Our analysis focuses first on a single parasitemia peak and then on the dynamics of multiple peaks that rely on stochastic switching between groups of parasite variants. A major feature of trypanosome infections is the interaction between variant-specific host immunity and density-dependent parasite differentiation to transmission life stages. In this study, we investigate how the interplay between these two types of control depends on the modular structure of the parasite antigenic archive. Our model shows that the degree of synchronization in stochastic variant emergence determines the relative dominance of general over specific control within a single peak. A requirement for multiple-peak dynamics is a critical switch rate between blocks of antigenic variants, which implies constraints on variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) archive genetic diversification. Our study illustrates the importance of quantifying the links between parasite genetics and within-host dynamics and provides insights into the evolution of trypanosomes. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","African trypanosome; Antigenic variation; Carrying capacity; Specific and general control; VSG archive structure; Within-host dynamics","antigen; carrying capacity; disease transmission; dominance; genetic differentiation; genomics; host-parasite interaction; immunity; infectious disease; numerical model; pathogenicity; population dynamics; stochasticity; trypanosomiasis; Africa",,,,,,"Agur, Z., Abiri, D., Van Der Ploeg, L.H., Ordered appearance of antigenic variants of African trypanosomes explained in a mathematical model based on a stochastic switch process and immune selection against putative switch intermediates (1989) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 86, pp. 9626-9630; Alizon, S., Van Baalen, M., Acute or chronic? within-host models with immune dynamics, infection outcome, and parasite evolution (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. E244-E256; Antia, R., Nowak, M.A., Anderson, R., Antigenic variation and the within-host dynamics of parasites (1996) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 93, pp. 985-989; Balber, A., Trypanosoma brucei: Fluxes of the morphological variants in intact and x-irradiated mice (1972) Experimental Parasitology, 31, pp. 307-319; Barbour, A.G., Dai, Q., Restrepo, B.I., Stoenner, H.G., Frank, S.A., Pathogen escape from host immunity by a genome program for antigenic variation (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 103, pp. 18290-18295; Barry, J., Antigenic variation during Trypanosoma vivax infections of different host species (1986) Parasitology, 92, pp. 51-65; The relative significance of mechanisms of antigenic variation in African trypanosomes (1997) Parasitology Today, 13, pp. 212-218; Barry, J., McCulloch, R., Antigenic variation in trypanosomes: Enhanced phenotypic variation in a eukaryotic parasite (2001) Advances in Parasitology, 49, pp. 1-70; Berriman, M., Ghedin, E., Hertz-Fowler, C., Blandin, G., Renauld, H., Bartholomeu, D., Lennard, N., Haas, B., The genome of the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei (2005) Science, 309, pp. 416-422; Capbern, A., Giroud, C., Baltz, T., Mattern, P., Trypanosoma equiperdum: Study of antigenic variations in the course of experimental trypanosomiasis in rabbits (1977) Experimental Parasitology, 42 (1), pp. 6-13; Dean, S., Marchetti, R., Kirk, K., Matthews, R., A surface transporter family conveys the trypanosome differentiation signal (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 213-217; Fenton, A., Lello, J., Bonsall, M., Pathogen responses to host immunity: The impact of time delays and memory on the evolution of virulence (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 2083-2090; Frank, S.A., A model for sequential dominance in African trypanosome infections (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 266, pp. 1397-1401; (2002) Immunology and Evolution of Infectious Disease, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Gray, A., Antigenic variation in a strain of Trypanosoma brucei transmitted by Glossina morsitans and G. palpalis (1965) Journal of General Microbiology, 41, pp. 195-214; Hajduk, S.L., Vickerman, K., Antigenic variation in cyclically transmitted Trypanosoma brucei.

However, it has been studied almost exclusively in predator-prey systems, despite the fact that it may evolve in other groups, such as ectoparasites. The principle defense of hosts against ectoparasites is grooming behavior, which has a visual component. Host-imposed selection should lead to the evolution of background matching if it helps ectoparasites escape from grooming. Here we use sister taxa comparisons to show that avian feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) have evolved coloration that matches the host's plumage, except in the case of head lice, which are protected from grooming. We also show covariation of parasite and host color within a single species of louse. Thus, cryptic coloration has evolved both within and between species of feather lice. Other examples of the evolution of crypsis presumably exist among the 70,000 known species of ectoparasites that collectively represent five animal phyla. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Background-matching coloration; Bird; Camouflage; Crypsis; Lice","behavioral ecology; bird; color morph; defense behavior; ectoparasite; insect; natural selection; predator-prey interaction; taxonomy",,,,,,"Barraclough, T.G., Vogler, A.P., Harvey, P.H., Revealing the factors that promote speciation (1998) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 353, pp. 241-249; Bush, S.E., Clayton, D.H., The role of body size in host specificity: Reciprocal transfer experiments with feather lice (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 2158-2167; Clayton, D.H., Mate choice in experimentally parasitized rock doves: Lousy males lose (1990) American Zoologist, 30, pp. 251-262; Coevolution of avian grooming and ectoparasite avoidance (1991) Birdparasite Interactions: Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour, pp. 258-289. , J.

One phenotype that is of particular interest to biologists is genomic imprinting, which results in parent-of-origin-specific gene expression and thus deviates from the predictions of Mendel's rules. The most prominent explanation for the evolution of genomic imprinting, the kinship theory, originally specified that multiple paternity can cause the evolution of imprinting when offspring affect maternal resource provisioning. Most models of the kinship theory do not detail how population subdivision, demography, and life history affect the evolution of imprinting. In this work, we embed the classic kinship theory within an island model of population structure and allow for diverse demographic and life-history features to affect the direction of selection on imprinting. We find that population structure does not change how multiple paternity affects the evolution of imprinting under the classic kinship theory. However, if the degree of multiple paternity is not too large, we find that sex-specific migration and survival and generation overlap are the primary factors determining which allele is silenced.

In competition to attract females, males may modify sexual selection by choosing social environments in which they are more attractive relative to rivals. Across the population, such behaviors should influence sexual selection patterns by altering the relationship between male mating success and sexual ornament elaboration. Here we use network analysis to examine patterns of male social behavior in relation to plumage ornamentation and mating success in a free-living population of house finches. During the nonbreeding season, less elaborate males changed associations with distinct social groups more frequently, compared to more elaborate males that showed greater fidelity to a single social group. By the onset of pair formation, socially labile males effectively increased their attractiveness relative to other males in the same flocks. Consequently, males that frequently moved between social groups had greater pairing success than less social individuals with equivalent sexual ornamentation. We discuss these results in relation to conditional mating tactics and the role of social behavior in evolutionary change by sexual selection. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Carpodacus mexicanus;

However, it remains unclear what factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively different defenses might alter ecological interactions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Evolutionary computation; Foraging-predation risk trade-off; Inducible defense; Phenotypic plasticity; Predator-prey","defense mechanism; evolutionary theory; foraging efficiency; growth rate; life history trait; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; reproductive productivity; trade-off; animal; animal behavior; article; biological model; body size; escape behavior; evolution; feeding behavior; food chain; phenotype; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Escape Reaction; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Phenotype",,,,,,"Abrahams, M., Healey, M., A comparison of the willingness of four species of Pacific salmon to risk exposure to a predator (1993) Oikos, 66, pp. 439-446; Abrams, P.A., Life-history and the relationship between food availability and foraging effort (1991) Ecology, 72, pp. 1242-1252; Predators that benefit prey and prey that harm predators: Unusual effects of interacting foraging adaptations (1992) American Naturalist, 140, pp. 573-600; Implications of dynamically variable traits for identifying, classifying, and measuring direct and indirect effects in ecological communities (1995) American Naturalist, 146, pp. 112-134; Describing and quantifying interspecific interactions: A commentary on recent approaches (2001) Oikos, 94, pp. 209-218; Abrams, P.A., Rowe, L., The effects of predation on the age and size of maturity of prey (1996) Evolution, 50, pp. 1052-1061; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Harada, Y., Evolutionarily unstable fitness maxima and stable fitness minima of continuous traits (1993) Evolutionary Ecology, 7, pp. 465-487; Anholt, B.R., Werner, E.E., Skelly, D.K., Effect of food and predators on the activity of four larval ranid frogs (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 3509-3521; Ball, S.L., Baker, R.L., Predator-induced life history changes: Antipredator behavior costs or facultative life history shifts?

Classical explanations for the evolution of SRA focus on improving offspring fitness in light of resource availability or mate attractiveness. Here, we use genetic models to demonstrate that SRA can evolve to alleviate sexual antagonism by improving the chance that the alleles of a sexually antagonistic trait are transmitted to the sex they benefit. In cases where the trait is autosomally inherited, this result is obtained regardless of whether SRA is based on the mother's or the father's genotype and irrespective of the recombination rate between the trait and SRA loci. SRA also evolves in this manner when the trait is sex-linked, provided that SRA decisions are based on the homogametic genotype (XX mothers or ZZ fathers). By contrast, when based on traits in the heterogametic sex, SRA promotes fixation of the allele that is detrimental to that sex, preventing the evolution of substantial levels of SRA. Our models indicate that the evolution of SRA in nature should be strongly influenced by the genetic architecture of the traits on which it is based and the form of selection affecting them. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Evolutionary theory; Inheritance; Intralocus sexual conflict; Sex allocation","allele; antagonism; brood rearing; evolutionary theory; fitness; genetic engineering; genotype; heritability; mate attraction; parental investment; resource availability; sex allocation; sex ratio; sexual conflict; sexual selection; animal; article; computer simulation; evolution; female; genetic linkage; male; mate choice; mutation; physiology; sex ratio; theoretical model; Animals; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Female; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Models, Theoretical; Mutation; Sex Ratio",,,,,,"Aars, J., Andreassen, H.P., Ims, R.A., Root voles: Litter sex ratio variation in fragmented habitat (1995) Journal of Animal Ecology, 64, pp. 459-472; Albert, A.Y.K., Otto, S.P., Sexual selection can resolve sex-linked sexual antagonism (2005) Science, 310, pp. 119-121; Alonzo, S.H., Sinervo, B., The effect of sexually antagonistic selection on adaptive sex ratio allocation (2007) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9, pp. 1097-1117; Badyaev, A.V., Growing apart: An ontogenetic perspective on the evolution of sexual size dimorphism (2002) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 17, pp. 369-378; Badyaev, A.V., Martin, T.E., Sexual dimorphism in relation to current selection in the house finch (2000) Evolution, 54, pp. 987-997; Björklund, M., Senar, J.C., Sex differences in survival selection in the serin, Serinus serinus (2001) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 14, pp. 841-849; Bodmer, W.F., Edwards, A.W.F., Natural selection and the sex ratio (1960) Annals of Human Genetics, 24, pp. 239-244; Bonduriansky, R., Chenoweth, S.F., Intralocus sexual conflict (2009) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 24, pp. 280-288; Burley, N., Sex ratio manipulation and selection for attractiveness (1981) Science, 211, pp. 721-722; Sex-ratio manipulation in color-banded populations of zebra finches (1986) Evolution, 40, pp. 1191-1206; Burton-Chellew, M.N., Koevoets, T., Grillenberger, B.K., Sykes, E.M., Underwood, S.L., Bijlsma, R., Gadau, J., Facultative sex ratio adjustment in natural populations of wasps: Cues of local mate competition and the precision of adaptation (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. 393-404; Calsbeek, R., Bonneaud, C., Postcopulatory fertilization bias as a form of cryptic sexual selection (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 1137-1148; Calsbeek, R., Sinervo, B., Uncoupling direct and indirect components of female choice in the wild (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 99, pp. 14897-14902; Within-clutch variation in offspring sex determined by differences in sire body size: Cryptic mate choice in the wild (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 17, pp. 464-470; Chippindale, A.K., Gibson, J.R., Rice, W.R., Negative genetic correlation for adult fitness between sexes reveals ontogenetic conflict in Drosophila (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 98, pp. 1671-1675; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Iason, G.R., Sex ratio variation in mammals (1986) Quarterly Review of Biology, 61, pp. 339-374; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Albon, S.D., Guinness, F.E., Maternal dominance, breeding success and birth sex ratios in red deer (1984) Nature, 308, pp. 358-360; Great expectations: Dominance, breeding success and offspring sex ratios in red deer (1986) Animal Behaviour, 34, pp. 460-471; Cockburn, A., Legge, S., Double, M.C., Sex ratios in birds and mammals: Can the hypotheses be disentangled?

Ecological opportunity facilitates this process, resulting in rapid divergence of ecological traits in many celebrated radiations. In other cases, sexual selection is thought to fuel divergence in mating signals ahead of ecological divergence. Comparing divergence rates between naturally and sexually selected traits can offer insights into processes underlying species radiations, but to date such comparisons have been largely qualitative. Here, we quantitatively compare divergence rates for four traits in African mormyrid fishes, which use an electrical communication system with few extrinsic constraints on divergence. We demonstrate rapid signal evolution in the Paramormyrops species flock compared to divergence in morphology, size, and trophic ecology. This disparity in the tempo of trait evolution suggests that sexual selection is an important early driver of species radiation in these mormyrids. We also found slight divergence in ecological traits among closely related species, consistent with a supporting role for natural selection in Paramormyrops diversification. Our results highlight the potential for sexual selection to drive explosive signal divergence when innovations in communication open new opportunities in signal space, suggesting that opportunity can catalyze species radiations through sexual selection, as well as natural selection. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Electric organ discharge; Key innovation; Private communication channel; Sexual selection; Speciation","adaptive radiation; divergence; heterogeneity; innovation; mating success; resource scarcity; sexual selection; signal; species flock; teleost; animal; animal communication; article; body size; electric fish; evolution; female; male; mate choice; physiology; regression analysis; species difference; species differentiation; Animal Communication; Animals; Body Size; Electric Fish; Evolution; Female; Genetic Speciation; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Regression Analysis; Species Specificity; Mormyridae; Paramormyrops; Pisces",,,,,,"Allender, C.J., Seehausen, O., Knight, M.E., Turner, G.F., Maclean, N., Divergent selection during speciation of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes inferred from parallel radiations in nuptial coloration (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, pp. 14074-14079; Alves-Gomes, J., Hopkins, C.D., Molecular insights into the phylogeny of mormyriform fishes and the evolution of their electric organs (1997) Brain, Behavior, and Evolution, 49, pp. 324-351; Arnegard, M.E., Carlson, B.A., Electric organ discharge patterns during group hunting by a mormyrid fish (2005) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 272, pp. 1305-1314; Arnegard, M.E., Hopkins, C.D., Electric signal variation among seven bluntsnouted Brienomyrus species (Teleostei: Mormyridae) from a riverine species flock in Gabon, Central Africa (2003) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 67, pp. 321-339; Arnegard, M.E., Kondrashov, A.S., Sympatric speciation by sexual selection alone is unlikely (2004) Evolution, 58, pp. 222-237; Arnegard, M.E., Bogdanowicz, S.M., Hopkins, C.D., Multiple cases of striking genetic similarity between alternate electric fish signal morphs in sympatry (2005) Evolution, 59, pp. 324-343; Arnegard, M.E., Jackson, B.S., Hopkins, C.D., Timedomain signal divergence and discrimination without receptor modification in sympatric morphs of electric fishes (2006) Journal of Experimental Biology, 209, pp. 2182-2198; Arnqvist, G., Edvardsson, M., Friberg, U., Nilsson, T., Sexual conflict promotes speciation in insects (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 97, pp. 10460-10464; Baier, B., Effect of conductivity changes on the stability of electric signal waveforms in dwarf stonebashers (Mormyridae; Pollimyrus castelnaui, P. marianne) (2008) Journal of Comparative Physiology a, 194, pp. 915-919; Barraclough, T.G., Harvey, P.H., Nee, S., Sexual selection and taxonomic diversity in passerine birds (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 259, pp. 211-215; Bass, A.H., Electric organs revisited: Evolution of a vertebrate communication and orientation organ (1986) Electroreception, pp. 13-70. , T.

Although the analytical framework for Bateman gradients aimed at covering all sexual systems, empirical studies are biased toward separate-sex organisms, probably because important characteristics of other systems remain incompletely treated. Our synthesis complements the existing Bateman gradient approach with three essential reproductive features of simultaneous hermaphrodites. First, mating in one sex may affect fitness via the opposite sex, for example, through energetic trade-offs. We integrate cross-sex selection effects and show how they help characterizing sexually mutualistic versus antagonistic selection. Second, male and female mating successes may be correlated, complicating the interpretation of Bateman gradients. We show how to quantify the impact of this correlation on sexual selection and propose a principal component analysis on male and female mating success to facilitate interpretation. Third, self-fertilization is accounted for by adding selfed progeny as a separate category of reproductive success to analyses of Bateman gradients. Finally, using a worked example from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, we illustrate how the extended analytical framework can enhance our understanding of sexual selection in hermaphroditic animals and plants. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Mating success; Reciprocal sperm exchange; Reproductive success; Selfing; Sex allocation; Sexual antagonism","analytical framework; antagonism; autogamy; bioenergetics; empirical analysis; fitness; freshwater ecosystem; hermaphrodite; mating success; principal component analysis; reproductive success; sex allocation; sexual selection; snail; sperm; trade-off; Animalia; Biomphalaria glabrata; Gastropoda; animal; article; Biomphalaria; female; hermaphroditism; male; mate choice; physiology; statistical analysis; Animals; Biomphalaria; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Hermaphroditism; Male; Mating Preference, Animal",,,,,,"Andersson, M., Iwasa, Y., Sexual selection (1996) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 11, pp. 53-58; Anthes, N., Michiels, N.K., Reproductive morphology, mating behaviour, and spawning ecology of cephalaspid sea slugs (Aglajidae and Gastropteridae) (2007) Invertebrate Biology, 126, pp. 335-365; Anthes, N., Putz, A., Michiels, N.K., Gender trading in a hermaphrodite (2005) Current Biology, 15, pp. R792-R793; Sex role preferences, gender conflict and sperm trading in simultaneous hermaphrodites: A new framework (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 1-12; Anthes, N., Schulenburg, H., Michiels, N.K., Evolutionary links between reproductive morphology, ecology and mating behavior in opisthobranch gastropods (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 900-916; Arnold, S.J., Bateman's principles and the measurement of sexual selection in plants and animals (1994) American Naturalist, 144 (SUPPL.), pp. S126-S149; Arnold, S.J., Duvall, D., Animal mating systems: A synthesis based on selection theory (1994) American Naturalist, 143, pp. 317-348; Arnold, S.J., Wade, M.J., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Applications (1984) Evolution, 38, pp. 720-734; Ashman, T.-L., Morgan, M.T., Explaining phenotypic selection on plant attractive characters: Male function, gender balance or ecological context?

A simple yet untested prediction is that mutator bacteria are able to compensate more quickly for pleiotropic fitness costs often associated with resistance, resulting in the maintenance of resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection. By using experimental populations of a wild-type and a mutator genotype of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we show that mutator bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics more rapidly than wild-type bacteria and, crucially, that mutators are better able to compensate for the fitness cost of resistance, to the extent that all costs of resistance were entirely compensated for in mutators. When competed against immigrant antibiotic-susceptible bacteria in the absence of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance remained at a high level in mutator populations but disappeared in wild-type populations. These results suggest that selection for mutations that offset the fitness cost associated with antibiotic resistance may help to explain the high frequency of mutator bacteria and antibiotic resistance observed in chronic infections. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Antimicrobial resistance; Chronic infection; Immigration; Mutator bacteria; Pleiotropic fitness cost","antiinfective agent; rifampicin; adaptation; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; fitness; genotype; immigration; infectivity; mutation; pathogen; pleiotropy; wild population; adaptation; antibiotic resistance; article; drug effect; genetic selection; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; mutation; physiology; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; time; Adaptation, Physiological; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genotype; Mutation; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Rifampin; Selection, Genetic; Time Factors; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas aeruginosa",,"rifampicin, 13292-46-1; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Rifampin, 13292-46-1",,,,"Agresti, A., A survey of exact inference for contingency tables (1992) Statistical Science, 7, pp. 131-153; Andersson, D.I., The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: Any practical conclusions?

Here, we show that density-dependent sex ratio adjustment in response to sexual selection may be a common AE mechanism. Specifically, using an analytical model we show that an AE is expected whenever one sex is more fecund than the other and sex ratio bias toward the less fecund sex increases with density. We illustrate the robustness of this pattern, using Monte Carlo simulations, against a range of body size-fecundity relationships and sexallocation strategies. Finally, we test the model using the sex-changing polygynous reef fish Parapercis cylindrica; positive density dependence in the strength of sexual selection for male size is evidenced as the causal mechanism driving local sex ratio adjustment, hence the AE. Model application may extend to invertebrates, reptiles, birds, and mammals, in addition to over 70 reef fishes. We suggest that protected areas may often outperform harvest quotas as a conservation tool since the latter promotes population fragmentation, reduced polygyny, a balancing of the sex ratio, and hence up to a 50% decline in per capita fecundity, while the former maximizes polygyny and source-sink potential. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Polygyny;

Recent theoretical works suggest that these constraints can have a significant impact and should not be neglected. However, it is not yet resolved how stoichiometry should be integrated in population dynamical models, as different modeling approaches are found to yield qualitatively different results. Here we investigate a unifying framework that reveals the differences and commonalities between previously proposed models for producergrazer systems. Our analysis reveals that stoichiometric constraints affect the dynamics mainly by increasing the intraspecific competition between producers and by introducing a variable biomass conversion efficiency. The intraspecific competition has a strongly stabilizing effect on the system, whereas the variable conversion efficiency resulting from a variable food quality is the main determinant for the nature of the instability once destabilization occurs. Only if the food quality is high can an oscillatory instability, as in the classical paradox of enrichment, occur. While the generalized model reveals that the generic insights remain valid in a large class of models, we show that other details such as the specific sequence of bifurcations encountered in enrichment scenarios can depend sensitively on assumptions made in modeling stoichiometric constraints. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bifurcation analysis; Food quality; Generalized model; Paradox of enrichment; Stoichiometry; Variable efficiency","biomass; food quality; intraspecific competition; population dynamics; producer-scrounger interaction; stoichiometry; animal; article; biological model; biomass; energy metabolism; food; food chain; plant physiology; standard; Animals; Biomass; Energy Metabolism; Food; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Plant Physiological Phenomena",,,,,,"Andersen, T., Pelagic nutrient cycles: Herbivores as sources and sinks (1997) Ecological Studies Series, 129. , Springer, Berlin; Andersen, T., Elser, J., Hessen, D., Stoichiometry and population dynamics (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 884-900; DeAngelis, D.L., Stability and connectance in food web models (1975) Ecology, 56, pp. 238-243; Dynamics of nutrient cycling and food webs (1992) Population and Community Biology Series, , Chapman & Hall, London; Deng, B., Loladze, I., Competitive coexistence in stoichiometric chaos (2007) Chaos, 17, pp. 1-14; Diehl, S., Paradoxes of enrichment: Effects of increased light versus nutrient supply on pelagic producer-grazer systems (2007) American Naturalist, 169, pp. E173-E191; Doedel, E.J., Oldeman, B., Auto 97: Continuation and bifurcation software for ordinary differential equations (with homcont) (2009) Technical Report, , Concordia University, Montreal; Doedel, E.J., Champneys, A.R., Fairgrieve, T.F., Kuznetsov, Y.A., Sandstede, B., Wang, X., Auto 97: Continuation and bifurcation software for ordinary differential equations (with homcont) (1997) Technical Report, , Concordia University, Montreal; Fell, D.A., Sauro, H.M., Metabolic control and its analysis: Additional relationships between elasticities and control coefficients (1985) European Journal of Biochemistry, 148, pp. 555-561; Gardner, M.R., Ashby, W.R., Connectance of large dynamic (cybernetic) systems: Critical values for stability (1970) Nature, 228, p. 784; Gross, T., Feudel, U., Generalized models as a universal approach to nonlinear dynamical systems (2006) Physical Review e, 73, p. 016205; Gross, T., Ebenhöh, W., Feudel, U., Enrichment and foodchain stability: The impact of different forms of predator-prey interaction (2004) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 227, pp. 349-358; Gross, T., Rudolf, L., Levin, S.A., Dieckmann, U., Generalized models reveal stabilizing factors in food webs (2009) Science, 325, pp. 747-750; Grover, J.P., The impact of variable stoichiometry on predatorprey interactions: A multinutrient approach (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 29-43; Guckenheimer, J., Holmes, P., Nonlinear oscillations, dynamical systems, and bifurcations of vector fields (2002) Applied Mathematical Sciences, 42. , 7th ed.

However, our knowledge of the specific physiological mechanisms underlying carryover effects remains rudimentary, and specific examples remain rare. Here we show that female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) initiate vitellogenesis and yolk formation while at sea during return migrations to breeding colonies; yolk formation takes approximately 16 days, but females lay only 7-14 days after their return. Once on land, Eudyptes penguins show a unique reproductive pattern of extreme egg size dimorphism in which the smaller, first-laid A-egg is 55%-75% of the size of the larger B-egg. We show that the degree of egg size dimorphism is inversely correlated with time between arrival and laying; that is, females that begin reproductive development well in advance of their return produce more dimorphic eggs. Furthermore, late-arriving females that produce the most dimorphic eggs have lower plasma levels of the yolk precursor vitellogenin on arrival; that is, they show lower reproductive ""readiness."" These data support the hypothesis that extreme egg size dimorphism in Eudyptes penguins is due to a physiological constraint imposed by a migratory carryover effect and argue against small A-eggs having a specific, adaptive function. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Carryover effect; Egg development; Eudyptes; Physiological conflict; Reproductive trade-off; Vitellogenin","vitellogenin; adaptive radiation; breeding population; breeding site; dimorphism; egg development; egg size; individual variation; life history trait; migratory population; physiological response; protein; reproductive productivity; return migration; seabird; trade-off; animal; article; blood; female; hematocrit; male; penguin; physiology; population migration; reproduction; time; zygote; Animal Migration; Animals; Female; Hematocrit; Male; Reproduction; Spheniscidae; Time Factors; Vitellogenins; Zygote; Eudyptes; Eudyptes chrysolophus; Spheniscidae",,"Vitellogenins",,,,"Astheimer, L.B., Grau, C.R., A comparison of yolk growth rates in seabird eggs (1990) Ibis, 132, pp. 380-394; Bauchinger, U., Van't Hof, T., Biebach, H., Testicular development during long-distance spring migration (2007) Hormones and Behavior, 51, pp. 295-305; Bost, C.A., Thiebot, J.B., Pinaud, D., Cherel, Y., Trathan, P.N., Where do penguins go during the inter-breeding season? using geolocation to track the winter dispersion of the macaroni penguin (2009) Biology Letters, 5, pp. 473-476; Caro, S.P., Charmantier, A., Lambrechts, M.M., Blondel, J., Balthazart, J., Williams, T.D., Local adaptation of timing of reproduction: Females are in the driver's seat (2009) Functional Ecology, 23, pp. 172-179; Challenger, W.O., Williams, T.D., Christians, J.K., Vézina, F., Follicular development and plasma yolk precursor dynamics through the laying cycle in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (2001) Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 74, pp. 356-365; Christians, J.K., Avian egg size: Variation within species and inflexibility within individuals (2002) Biological Reviews, 77, pp. 1-26; Dawson, A., Control of the annual cycle in birds: Endocrine constraints and plasticity in response to ecological variability (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 363, pp. 1621-1633; Deeley, R.G., Mullinix, K.P., Wetekam, W., Kronenberg, H.M., Meyers, M., Eldridge, J.D., Goldberger, R.F., Vitellogenin synthesis in the avian liver (1975) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 250, pp. 9060-9066; Drabkin, D.L., Austin, J.H., Spectrophotometric constants for common haemoglobin derivatives in human, dog, and rabbit blood (1932) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 98, pp. 719-723; Gilbert, A.B., Female genital orgasm (1979) Form and Function in Birds, pp. 237-360. , A.

For instance, the ecological consequences of cooccurrence of ant-tended insects on a plant have never been examined for survival effects on either trophobiont species. Here, we assess the selective pressures mediating co-occurrence of a facultative ant-tended butterfly (Parrhasius polibetes) with ant-tended treehoppers (Guayaquila xiphias) on Schefflera vinosa shrubs. We evaluated host plant selection and caterpillar survival in P. polibetes in the presence and absence of ant-treehopper associations. Paired trials revealed that butterflies preferably oviposit on branches hosting anttended treehoppers when they had a choice between those and branches without this interaction. Presence of ant-tended treehoppers on a branch reduced the abundance of P. polibetes' natural enemies and improved caterpillar survival in both premyrmecophylic and anttended phases. Thus ant-tended treehoppers create an enemy-free space on foliage that butterflies exploit to protect larval offspring. These findings connect two widely documented ant-trophobiont mutualisms and highlight the importance of considering multiple interactions for a proper understanding of ant-plant-herbivore systems. Detection of other ant-based mutualisms on oviposition to improve offspring survival may have represented an important evolutionary step in the process of host plant selection in facultative myrmecophilous butterflies. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Ant-plant-herbivore interactions; Cerrado savanna; Insect trophobionts; Natural enemies; Oviposition behavior; Trophic and nontrophic indirect effects","ant; butterfly; caterpillar; enemy free space; foliage; mutualism; myrmecophily; natural enemy; oviposition; plant-herbivore interaction; savanna; shrub; survival; trophic interaction; analysis of variance; animal; ant; Araliaceae; article; butterfly; genetic selection; Hemiptera; larva; physiology; population density; survival; symbiosis; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Ants; Araliaceae; Butterflies; Hemiptera; Larva; Population Density; Selection, Genetic; Survival Analysis; Symbiosis; Guayaquila xiphias; Hexapoda; Membracidae; Papilionoidea; Schefflera",,,,,,"Atsatt, P.R., Ant-dependent food plant selection by the mistletoe butterfly Ogyris amaryllis (Lycaenidae) (1981) Oecologia (Berlin), 48, pp. 60-63; Lycaenidae butterflies and ants: Selection for enemyfree space (1981) American Naturalist, 118, pp. 638-654; Bronstein, J.L., Barbosa, P., Multitrophic/multispecies mutualistic interactions: The role of non-mutualists in shaping and mediating mutualisms (2002) Multitrophic Level Interactions, pp. 44-66. , T.

We derive a plant-based metaecosystem model to analyze how the spatial flows of the biotic and abiotic forms of a limiting nutrient affect persistence and coexistence. We show that the proportion of patches supporting plants in a region has a considerable impact on local nutrient dynamics. Then we explicitly couple nutrient dynamics to patch dynamics. Our model shows strong feedback between local and regional dynamics mediated by nutrient flows. We find that nutrient flows can have either positive or negative effects on species persistence and coexistence. The essential feature of this local-regional coupling is the net direction of the nutrient flows between occupied and empty patches. A net flow of nutrients from occupied to empty patches leads to indirect facilitative interactions, such as an inferior competitor promoting the persistence of a superior competitor. We show that nutrient flows affect the potential diversity of the metaecosystem and key features of plant community dynamics, such as the shape of the competition-colonization trade-off and successional sequences. Our analysis revealed that integrating ecosystem and spatial dynamics can lead to various indirect interactions that contribute significantly to community organization. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Coexistence; Ecosystem ecology; Metacommunity; Metaecosystem; Nutrient recycling; Patch dynamics","coexistence; colonization; community dynamics; nutrient cycling; nutrient dynamics; patch dynamics; persistence; trade-off; article; biological model; ecosystem; plant physiology; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Plant Physiological Phenomena",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Wilson, W.G., Coexistence of competitors in metacommunities due to spatial variation in resource growth rates: Does R <sup>*</sup> predict the outcome of competition?

Recent catastrophic shifts in Everglades landscape pattern and ecological function highlight the need to understand the feedbacks governing these ecosystems. We modeled feedback between vegetation, hydrology, and sediment transport on the basis of a decade of experimentation. Results from more than 100 simulations showed that flows just sufficient to redistribute sediment from sparsely vegetated sloughs to dense ridges were needed for an equilibrium patterned landscape oriented parallel to flow. Surprisingly, although vegetation heterogeneity typically conveys resilience, in wetlands governed by flow/sediment feedbacks it indicates metastability, whereby the landscape is prone to catastrophic shifts. Substantial increases ordecreases in flow relative to the equilibrium condition caused an expansion of emergent vegetation and loss of open-water areas that was unlikely to revert upon restoration of the equilibrium hydrology. Understanding these feedbacks is critical in forecasting wetland responses to changing conditions and designing management strategies that optimize ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration or habitat provision. Our model and new sensitivity analysis techniques address these issues and make it newly apparent that simply returning flow to predrainage conditions in the Everglades may not be sufficient to restore historic landscape patterns and processes.","Alternate stable states; Everglades; Modeling; Patterned landscapes; Sediment transport; Wetlands","carbon sequestration; ecosystem function; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; flow pattern; habitat mosaic; heterogeneity; landscape change; numerical model; open water; restoration ecology; sediment transport; self organization; sensitivity analysis; vegetation dynamics; wetland; article; computer simulation; plant physiology; sediment; theoretical model; United States; water flow; wetland; Computer Simulation; Florida; Geologic Sediments; Models, Theoretical; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Water Movements; Wetlands; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States",,,,,,"Belyea, L.R., Baird, A.J., Beyond ""the limits to peat bog growth"": Cross-scale feedback in peatland development (2006) Ecological Monographs, 76, pp. 299-322; Bernhardt, C.E., Willard, D.A., Response of the Everglades' ridge and slough landscape to climate variability and 20th-century water management (2009) Ecological Applications, 19, pp. 1723-1738; Brandt, L.A., Silveira, J.E., Kitchens, W.M., Tree islands of the Arthur R.

Blocking air flow with plastic bags made this effect undetectable. However, some scientists remained skeptical about the possibility of volatile communication between plants since the existence and identity of a cue that operates in nature have never been demonstrated. We conducted an air transfer experiment that collected air from the headspace of an experimentally clipped donor plant and delivered it to the headspace of an unclipped assay plant. We found that assay plants treated with air from clipped donors were less likely to be damaged by naturally occurring herbivores in a field experiment. This simple air transfer experiment fulfills the most critical of Koch's postulates and provides more definitive evidence for volatile communication between plants. It also provides an inexpensive experimental protocol that can be used to screen plants for interplant communication in the field. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Cue; Eavesdropping; Herbivory; Koch's postulates; Plant communication; Volatile","airflow; communication behavior; dicotyledon; environmental cue; herbivory; plant-herbivore interaction; plastic; volatile substance; Artemisia tridentata; animal; Artemisia; article; chemistry; feeding behavior; parasitology; physiology; plant physiology; volatilization; Animals; Artemisia; Feeding Behavior; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Volatilization",,,,,,"Arimura, G., Shiojiri, K., Karban, R., Acquired immunity to herbivory via airborne plant communication (2010) Phytochemistry (forthcoming); Baldwin, I.T., Schultz, J.C., Rapid changes in tree leaf chemistry induced by damage: Evidence for communication between plants (1983) Science, 221, pp. 277-279; Baldwin, I.T., Halitschke, R., Paschold, A., Von Dahl, C.C., Preston, C.A., Volatile signaling in plant-plant interactions: ""talking trees"" in the genomics era (2006) Science, 311, pp. 812-815; Brock, T.D., (1999) Robert Koch: A Life in Medicine and Bacteriology, , American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, DC; Cohen, J., Fulfilling Koch's postulates (1994) Science, 266, p. 1647; Cook, C.W., Stoddart, L.A., Physiological responses of big sagebrush to different types of herbage removal (1960) Journal of Range Management, 13, pp. 14-16; Dicke, M., Bruin, J., Chemical information transfer between plants: Back to the future (2001) Biochemical Systematics and Ecology, 29 (10), pp. 981-994. , DOI 10.1016/S0305-1978(01)00045-X, PII S030519780100045X; Farmer, E.E., Ryan, C.A., Interplant communication: Airborne methyl jasmonate induces synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in plant leaves (1990) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 87, pp. 7713-7716; Hecht, S.S., Progress and challenges in selected areas of tobacco carcinogenesis (2008) Chemical Research in Toxicology, 21, pp. 160-171; Heil, M., Karban, R., Explaining the evolution of plant communication by airborne signals (2010) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 25, pp. 137-144; Karban, R., Plant behaviour and communication (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 727-739; Karban, R., Maron, J., Felton, G.W., Ervin, G., Eichenseer, H., Herbivore damage to sagebrush induces wild tobacco: Evidence for eavesdropping between plants (2003) Oikos, 100, pp. 325-333; Karban, R., Huntzinger, M., McCall, A.C., The specificity of eavesdropping on sagebrush by other plants (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1846-1852; Karban, R., Shiojiri, K., Huntzinger, M., McCall, A.C., Damage-induced resistance in sagebrush: Volatiles are key to intraand interplant communication (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 922-930; Paschold, A., Halitschke, R., Baldwin, I.T., Using ""mute"" plants to translate volatile signals (2006) Plant Journal, 45, pp. 275-291; Preston, C.A., Laue, G., Baldwin, I.T., Methyl jasmonate is blowing in the wind, but can it act as a plant-plant airborne signal?

This hypothesis suggests that the number of species increases along the global energy gradient primarily as a result of an increase in the total number of individuals that can be supported along that gradient. Implicit in this hypothesis is that species richness should scale with energy in the same way in which it scales with area in species-area relationships. We developed a novel framework for thinking about the interaction of area and energy, and we provide the first global test of this equivalence assumption using a data set on terrestrial breeding birds. We found that (1) species-energy slopes are typically greater than species-area slopes, (2) the magnitude of species-area and species-energy slopes varies strongly across the globe, and (3) the degree to which area and energy interact to determine species richness depends on the way mean values of species occupancy change along the energy gradient. Our results indicate that the increase in richness along global productivity gradients cannot be explained by more individuals alone, and we discuss other mechanisms by which increased productivity might facilitate species coexistence. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Birds; Productivity; Scale; Species richness; Species-area relationship; Species-energy relationship","bioenergetics; biological production; bird; breeding population; coexistence; data set; hypothesis testing; species diversity; species richness; species-area relationship; animal; article; biodiversity; biological model; bird; geography; physiology; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Geography; Models, Biological; Aves",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Monotonic or unimodal diversity-productivity gradients: What does competition theory predict?

We explored how this thermodynamic effect on performance might influence selective pressures on thermal physiology. In the absence of a thermodynamic effect, natural selection favors a thermal optimum for performance that closely matches the mean (or modal) body temperature. When warmadapted organisms outperform cold-adapted organisms, natural selection can favor a thermal optimum that exceeds the mean body temperature. The optimal mismatch between the thermal optimum and the mean temperature increases as does the variation in body temperature within generations. This result holds regardless of whether performance affects fitness through fecundity or survivorship. The selective pressures generated by a thermodynamic effect might explain the substantial mismatch between thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology that has been observed in some species. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Heterogeneity; Performance; Temperature; Thermodynamics","body temperature; comparative study; evolutionary biology; fecundity; fitness; heterogeneity; natural selection; physiological response; survivorship; temperature effect; temperature tolerance; thermodynamics; thermoregulation; acclimatization; animal; article; biological model; evolution; genetic selection; temperature; thermodynamics; thermoregulation; Acclimatization; Animals; Body Temperature Regulation; Evolution; Models, Biological; Selection, Genetic; Temperature; Thermodynamics",,,,,,"Angilletta Jr., M.J., (2009) Thermal Adaptation: A Theoretical and Empirical Synthesis, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Niewiarowski, P.H., Navas, C.A., The evolution of thermal physiology in ectotherms (2002) Journal of Thermal Biology, 27, pp. 249-268; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Wilson, R.S., Navas, C.A., James, R.S., Tradeoffs and the evolution of thermal reaction norms (2003) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, pp. 234-240; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Steel, E.A., Bartz, K.K., Kingsolver, J.G., Scheuerell, M.D., Beckman, B.R., Crozier, L.G., Big dams and salmon evolution: Changes in thermal regimes and their potential evolutionary consequences (2008) Evolutionary Applications, 1, pp. 286-299; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Cooper, B.S., Schuler, M.S., Boyles, J.G., The evolution of thermal physiology in endotherms (2010) Frontiers in Bioscience E, 2, pp. 861-881; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Huey, R.B., Frazier, M.R., Thermodynamic effects on organismal performance: Is hotter better?

Empirical support for Allen's rule is mainly derived from occasional reports of geographical clines in extremity size of individual species. Interspecific evidence is restricted to two studies of leg proportions in seabirds and shorebirds. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses of 214 bird species to examine whether bird bills, significant sites of heat exchange, conform to Allen's rule. The species comprised eight diverse taxonomic groups-toucans, African barbets, Australian parrots, estrildid finches, Canadian galliforms, penguins, gulls, and terns. Across all species, there were strongly significant relationships between bill length and both latitude and environmental temperature, with species in colder climates having significantly shorter bills. Patterns supporting Allen's rule in relation to latitudinal or altitudinal distribution held within all groups except the finches. Evidence for a direct association with temperature was found within four groups (parrots, galliforms, penguins, and gulls). Support for Allen's rule in leg elements was weaker, suggesting that bird bills may be more susceptible to thermoregulatory constraints generally. Our results provide the strongest comparative support yet published for Allen's rule and demonstrate that thermoregulation has been an important factor in shaping the evolution of bird bills. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Altitude; Beak size; Ecogeographical rules; Latitude; Temperature; Thermoregulation","altitude; bird; body size; climate effect; cline; comparative study; endothermy; geographical distribution; geographical variation; heat flux; interspecific variation; latitude; limb; morphology; phylogenetics; taxonomy; temperature effect; thermoregulation; animal; article; beak; bird; body size; classification; climate; female; geography; histology; leg; phylogeny; species difference; temperature; thermoregulation; Animals; Beak; Birds; Body Size; Body Temperature Regulation; Climate; Female; Geography; Lower Extremity; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Temperature; Aves; Estrildidae; Fringillidae; Galliformes; Geopsittacus occidentalis; Laridae; Psittacidae; Spheniscidae",,,,,,"Allen, J.A., The influence of physical conditions in the genesis of species (1877) Radical Review, 1, pp. 108-140; Bergmann, C., Ü ber die verhältnisse der wärmeökonomie der thiere zu ihrer grösse (1847) Gottinger Studien, 3, pp. 595-708; Blackburn, T.M., Gaston, K.J., Spatial patterns in the body sizes of bird species in the New World (1996) Oikos, 77, pp. 436-446; Bull, L.S., Geographical variation in the morphology of the wedge-tailed shearwater (Puffinus pacificus) (2006) Emu, 106, pp. 233-243; Cartar, R.V., Morrison, R.I.G., Metabolic correlates of leg length in breeding arctic shorebirds: The cost of getting high (2005) Journal of Biogeography, 32, pp. 377-382; Ederstrom, H.E., Brumleve, S.J., Temperature gradients in the legs of cold-acclimatized pheasants (1964) American Journal of Physiology, 207, pp. 457-459; Fooden, J., Albrecht, G.H., Tail-length evolution in fascicularis-group macaques (Cercopithecidae: Macaca) (1999) International Journal of Primatology, 20, pp. 431-440; Grant, B.R., Grant, P.R., Evolution of Darwin's finches caused by a rare climatic event (1994) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 251, pp. 111-117; Grant, P.R., Grant, B.R., Evolution of character displacement in Darwin's finches (2006) Science, 313, pp. 224-226; Greenberg, R., Dissimilar bill shapes in New World tropical versus temperate forest foliage-gleaning birds (1981) Oecologia (Berlin), 49, pp. 143-147; Griffing, J.P., Body measurements of black-tailed jackrabbits of southeastern New Mexico with implications of Allen's rule (1974) Journal of Mammalogy, 55, pp. 674-678; Hagan, A.A., Heath, J.E., Regulation of heat loss in the duck by vasomotion in the bill (1980) Journal of Thermal Biology, 5, pp. 95-101; Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds (1999) Parrots to Dollarbird, 4. , Higgins, P.

Here we test key predictions of the challenge hypothesis in an independently evolved endocrine system: juvenile hormone (JH) in a social insect. We assess how social conflict influences JH titers in Polistes dominulus wasps. Aggressive conflict was produced by removing the queen from some colonies (experimental) and a low-ranked worker from other colonies (control). Queen removal produced competition among workers to fill the reproductive vacancy. Workers upregulated their JH titers in response to this social conflict; worker JH titers were higher in queenless than in queenright colonies. Furthermore, JH titers were associated with an individual's ability to dominate rivals; the worker that took over as the replacement queen had a substantially higher JH titer than did other workers. Finally, JH titers were positively associated with aggression in queenless colonies, but there was no relationship between JH and aggression in stable, queenright colonies. Overall, these results match key predictions of the challenge hypothesis and parallel much of the work on testosterone in vertebrates. Social modulation of hormone titers is not confined to a particular endocrine system but is likely to be an adaptive feature of endocrine systems across diverse taxa. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Aggression; Challenge hypothesis; Competition; Dominance; Juvenile hormone; Testosterone","juvenile hormone; testosterone; adaptation; aggression; endocrine system; hypothesis testing; intraspecific competition; queen; sexual conflict; social insect; testosterone; wasp; worker caste; adaptation; aggression; animal; article; conflict; female; male; metabolism; physiology; sexual behavior; social behavior; social dominance; wasp; Adaptation, Physiological; Aggression; Animals; Conflict (Psychology); Female; Juvenile Hormones; Male; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Testosterone; Wasps; Hexapoda; Polistes; Polistes dominulus; Vertebrata",,"testosterone, 58-22-0; Juvenile Hormones; Testosterone, 58-22-0",,,,"Adkins-Regan, E., (2005) Hormones and Animal Social Behavior, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Amdam, G.V., Nilsen, K.A., Norberg, K., Fondrk, M.K., Hartfelder, K., Variation in endocrine signaling underlies variation in social life history (2007) American Naturalist, 170, pp. 37-46; Ball, G.F., Balthazart, J., Individual variation and the endocrine regulation of behaviour and physiology in birds: A cellular/molecular perspective (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 363, pp. 1699-1710; Barth, R.H., Lester, L.J., Sroka, P., Kessler, T., Hearn, R., Juvenile hormone promotes dominance behavior and ovarian development in social wasps (Polistes annularis) (1975) Experientia, 31, pp. 691-692; Beehner, J.C., Bergman, T.J., Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., Whitten, P.L., Testosterone predicts future dominance rank and mating activity among male chacma baboons (2006) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 59, pp. 469-479; Bocher, A., Doums, C., Millot, L., Tirard, C., Reproductive conflicts affect labor and immune defense in the queenless ant Diacamma sp.

Nonneutrality of cytoplasmic genomes is particularly intriguing, given that these genomes are maternally transmitted. This means that the fate of any given cytoplasmic genetic mutation is directly tied to its performance when expressed in females. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that cytoplasmic genes will coevolve via a sexually antagonistic arms race with the biparentally transmitted nuclear genes with which they interact. We assess this prediction, examining the intergenomic contributions to the costs and benefits of mating in Callosobruchus maculatus females subjected to a mating treatment with three classes (kept virgin, mated once, or forced to cohabit with a male). We find no evidence that the economics of mating are determined by interactions between cytoplasmic genes expressed in females and nuclear genes expressed in males and, therefore, no support for a sexually antagonistic intergenomic arms race. The cost of mating to females was, however, shaped by an interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear genes expressed within females. Thus, cytonuclear interactions are embroiled in the economics of mating.. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Cost of mating; Cytonuclear; Cytoplasm; Evolution; Mitochondrial DNA; Sexual conflict","mitochondrial DNA; arms race; beetle; cytology; cytoplasm; female; gene expression; genetic variation; genome; heritability; hypothesis testing; mitochondrial DNA; mutation; reproductive cost; sexual conflict; animal; article; beetle; cytology; evolution; female; gene; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; genome; longevity; male; metabolism; physiology; sex difference; sexual behavior; Animals; Beetles; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution; Female; Genes; Genetic Variation; Genome, Insect; Longevity; Male; Selection, Genetic; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Bruchinae; Callosobruchus maculatus",,"DNA, Mitochondrial",,,,"Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., Sexual conflict and arms races between the sexes: A morphological adaptation for control of mating in a female insect (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 261, pp. 123-127; (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., Katvala, M., Mating rate and fitness in female bean weevils (2005) Behavioral Ecology, 16, pp. 123-127; Ayroles, J.F., Carbone, M.A., Stone, E.A., Jordan, K.W., Lyman, R.F., Magwire, M.M., Rollmann, S.M., Systems genetics of complex traits in Drosophila melanogaster (2009) Nature Genetics, 41, pp. 299-307; Ballard, J.W.O., Kreitman, M., Is mitochondrial DNA a strictly neutral marker?

One recurrent hypothesis is that these elaborated traits had a role in thermoregulation. This orthodoxy persists despite the observation that traits exaggerated to the point of impracticality in extant organisms are almost invariably sexually selected. We use allometric scaling to investigate the role of sexual selection and thermoregulation in the evolution of exaggerated traits of the crested pterosaur Pteranodon longiceps and the sail-backed eupelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus. The extraordinarily steep positive allometry of the head crest of Pteranodon rules out all of the current hypotheses for this trait's main function other than sexual signaling. We also find interspecific patterns of allometry and sexual dimorphism in the sails of Dimetrodon and patterns of elaboration in Edaphosaurus consistent with a sexually selected function. Furthermore, small ancestral, sailbacked pelycosaurs would have been too small to need adaptations to thermoregulation. Our results question the popular view that the elaborated structures of these fossil species evolved as thermoregulatory organs and provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that Pteranodon crests and eupelycosaur sails are among the earliest and most extreme examples of elaborate sexual signals in the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Condition dependence; Dinosaur; Lizard; Ornament; Reptile; Weapon","adaptation; allometry; body condition; body size; dinosaur; fossil record; hypothesis testing; interspecific interaction; life history trait; lizard; ornamentation; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; signaling; thermoregulation; vertebrate; animal; article; body size; dinosaur; evolution; female; fossil; histology; male; mate choice; orbit; physiology; sexual development; skull; thermoregulation; Animals; Body Size; Body Temperature Regulation; Dinosaurs; Evolution; Female; Fossils; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Orbit; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Dinosauria; Pteranodon; Reptilia; Squamata; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bakker, R.T., Dinosaur physiology and the origin of mammals (1970) Evolution, 25, pp. 636-658; Bennett, S.C., Sexual dimorphism of Pteranodon and other pterosaurs, with comments on cranial crests (1992) Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 12, pp. 422-434; A statistical study of Rhamphorhynchus from the Southern Limestone of Germany: Year-classes of a single large species (1995) Journal of Paleontology, 69, pp. 569-580; Aerodynamics and thermoregulatory function of the dorsal sail of the Edaphosaurus (1996) Paleobiology, 22, pp. 422-434; Benton, M.J., Kirkpatrick, R., Heterochrony in a fossil reptile: Juveniles of the rhynchosaur Scaphonyx fischeri from the Late Triassic of Brazil (1989) Palaeontology, 32, pp. 335-353; Berman, D.S., New species of Dimetrodon (Reptilia, Pelycosauria) from a non-deltaic facies in Lower Permian of northcentral New Mexico (1977) Journal of Paleontology, 51, pp. 108-115; Berman, D.S., Reisz, R.R., Martens, T., Henrici, A.C., A new species of Dimetrodon (Synapsida: Sphenacodontidae) from the Lower Permian of Germany records first occurrence of genus outside of North America (2001) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 38, pp. 803-812; Berman, D.S., Henrici, A.C., Sumida, S.S., Martens, T., New materials of Dimetrodon teutonis (Synapsida: Sphenacodontidae) from the Lower Permian of Germany (2004) Annals of Carnegie Museum, 73, pp. 108-116; Blanckenhorn, W.U., The evolution of body size: What keeps organisms small?

This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20% of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73% of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Biological network; Body size; Community structure; Latent variable; Phylogeny; Statistical model","body size; community structure; ecological modeling; food web; foraging behavior; habitat use; life history trait; microhabitat; mimicry; phylogeny; predator-prey interaction; statistical analysis; stochasticity; vulnerability; animal; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; body size; food chain; Monte Carlo method; predation; probability; species difference; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Body Size; Food Chain; Markov Chains; Models, Biological; Monte Carlo Method; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity",,,,,,"Allesina, S., Alonso, D., Pascual, M., A general model for food web structure (2008) Science, 320, pp. 658-661; Bersier, L.-F., Kehrli, P., The signature of phylogenetic constraints on food-web structure (2008) Ecological Complexity, 5, pp. 132-139; Bersier, L.-F., Banasek-Richter, C., Cattin, M.F., Quantitative descriptors of food-web matrices (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 2394-2407; Brose, U., Cushing, L., Berlow, E.L., Jonsson, T., Banasek-Richter, C., Bersier, L.-F., Blanchard, J.L., Body sizes of consumers and their resources (2005) Ecology, 86, p. 2545; Brose, U., Jonsson, T., Berlow, E.L., Warren, P., Banasek-Richter, C., Bersier, L.-F., Blanchard, J.L., Consumer-resource bodysize relationships in natural food webs (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 2411-2417; Cattin, M.F., Bersier, L.-F., Banasek-Richter, C., Baltensperger, R., Gabriel, J.P., Phylogenetic constraints and adaptation explain food-web structure (2004) Nature, 427, pp. 835-839; Cohen, J.E., Food webs and dimensionality of trophic niche space (1977) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 74, pp. 4533-4536; Cohen, J.E., Newman, C.M., A stochastic theory of community food webs.

The abstract nature of previous load models obscured the importance of ecological details in determining the softness of selection. Under the more ecologically explicit model used here, I show that genes related to intrinsic growth rate tend to experience hard selection whereas those genes affecting competitive ability experience softer selection. Although resource limitation determines the strength of selection on competitive ability, it only affects the softness of selection, and thus the load, of mutations with pleiotropic effects on intrinsic growth rate. While competition is typically considered necessary for soft selection, the model shows that interspecific competition hardens selection and can thereby lead to reduced load. Finally, genetic variation in the consumption rates of individuals who die before reproduction can cause supersoft selection, resulting in large increases in load. The same conditions that increase mutation load also increase inbreeding depression.. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Competition; Hard and soft selection; Mutation load; Population structure","anmontanin A; furan derivative; lactone; competitive ability; ecological modeling; genetic variation; growth rate; inbreeding depression; interspecific competition; mutation; natural selection; pleiotropy; population structure; resource selection; animal; article; biological model; ecosystem; evolution; genetic fitness; genetic selection; genetic variability; inbreeding; mutation; Animals; Ecosystem; Evolution; Furans; Genetic Fitness; Genetic Variation; Inbreeding; Lactones; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Selection, Genetic",,"lactone, 1338-03-0; Furans; Lactones; anmontanin A",,,,"Abrams, P.A., When does greater mortality increase population size? the long history and diverse mechanisms underlying the hydra effect (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 462-474; Agrawal, A.F., Chasnov, J.R., Recessive mutations and the maintenance of sex in structured populations (2001) Genetics, 158, pp. 913-917; Baer, C.F., Miyamoto, M.M., Denver, D.R., Mutation rate variation in multicellular eukaryotes: Causes and consequences (2007) Nature Reviews Genetics, 8, pp. 619-631; Boyd, R., Density-dependent mortality and the evolution of social interactions (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 972-982; Charlesworth, B., The heritability of fitness (1987) Sexual Selection: Testing the Alternatives, pp. 21-40. , in J.

Of particular interest is the often counterintuitive way in which infection and predation interact and the consequent difficulties in designing control strategies to manage the system. To understand the mechanisms involved, we focus on the pathogen exclusion problem, using control maps (on which the network of exclusion thresholds are plotted) in order to readily identify which exclusion strategies will work and why others will not. We apply this approach to the analysis of parasite exclusion in two game bird ecologies. For higher dimensions, we propose a computational scheme that will generate the optimal exclusion strategy, taking into account all operational constraints on the pathogen invasion matrix, populations, and controls. The situation is further complicated when external forcing distorts pathogen thresholds.

While carotenoids stimulate immunity and reduce oxidative stress during immune activity in vertebrates, their involvement in invertebrate immunity is unclear. Recently, a positive correlation between immune defenses and concentration of carotenoids in the hemolymph was demonstrated in the crustacean Gammarus pulex, suggesting an important role of carotenoids in invertebrate immunity. We tested the causality of this relationship by using a dietary supplementation with carotenoids and measuring several immune parameters. We found that dietary carotenoids had a broad immunostimulating effect, enhancing phenoloxidase activity and resistance to a bacterial infection. When immune challenged, gammarids fed with carotenoids did not pay an additional survival cost because of autoreactivity, despite their intensified immune activity. Therefore, dietary carotenoids improved gammarids' immunity without inducing additional self-harming. This underlines the importance of carotenoids in both the regulation and the evolution of immunity in G. pulex.. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Antioxidant; Ecological immunology; Immune costs; Immunostimulant","carotenoid; immunological adjuvant; antioxidant; bacterial disease; carotenoid; crustacean; enzyme activity; evolutionary theory; food supplementation; immune response; immunity; oxidation; survival; Amphipoda; animal; article; drug effect; immunology; innate immunity; microbiology; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Amphipoda; Animals; Carotenoids; Immunity, Innate; Bacteria (microorganisms); Crustacea; Gammaridae; Gammarus pulex; Invertebrata; Vertebrata",,"Adjuvants, Immunologic; Carotenoids, 36-88-4",,,,"Adamo, S.A., How should behavioural ecologists interpret measurements of immunity?

Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that in many cases the two processes occur on similar timescales and that such ""rapid"" evolution can have profound implications for the dynamics of communities and ecosystems. After briefly reviewing the timescale separations most common in coevolution theory, we use a general model of exploiter-victim coevolution to confront predictions from slow-evolution analysis with Monte Carlo simulations. We show how rapid evolution radically alters the dynamics and outcome of coevolutionary arms races. In particular, a fast-evolving exploiter can enable victim diversification and thereby lose a race it is expected to win. We explain simulation results, using mathematical analysis with relaxed timescale separations. Unusual mutation parameters are not required, since rapid evolution naturally emerges from slow competitive exclusion. Our results point to interesting consequences of exploiter rapid evolution and experimentally testable patterns, while indicating that more attention should be paid to rapid evolution in evolutionary theory. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive dynamics; Arms race; Diversification; Evolutionary keystone predator; Red queen; Timescale separation","adaptation; coevolution; community dynamics; ecosystem dynamics; evolutionary theory; mathematical analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; mutation; numerical model; article; biological model; evolution; genetic selection; Monte Carlo method; population dynamics; time; Evolution; Models, Biological; Monte Carlo Method; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Time Factors",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Character shifts of prey species that share predators (2000) American Naturalist, 156 (SUPPL.), pp. S45-S61; The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Modelling the adaptive dynamics of traits involved in inter-and intraspecific interactions: An assessment of three methods (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 166-175; Abrams, P.A., Kawecki, T.J., Adaptive host preference and the dynamics of host-parasitoid interactions (1999) Theoretical Population Biology, 56, pp. 307-324; Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Fitness minimization and dynamic instability as a consequence of predator-prey coevolution (1997) Evolutionary Ecology, 11, pp. 1-20; Best, A., White, A., Boots, M., The implications of coevolutionary dynamics to host-parasite interactions (2009) American Naturalist., 173, pp. 779-791; Brown, J.S., Vincent, T.L., Organization of predator-prey communities as an evolutionary game (1992) Evolution, 46, pp. 1269-1283; Champagnat, N., Ferrière, R., Méléard, S., Unifying evolutionary dynamics: From individual stochastic processes to macroscopic models (2006) Theoretical Population Biology, 69, pp. 297-321; Chesson, P., Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 343-366; Mazancourt, C., Dieckmann, U., Trade-off geometries and frequency-dependent selection (2004) American Naturalist, 164, pp. 765-778; Dercole, F., Ferrière, R., Gragnani, A., Rinaldi, S., Coevolution of slow-fast populations: Evolutionary sliding, evolutionary pseudo-equilibria and complex Red Queen dynamics (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 983-990; Dieckmann, U., Marrow, P., Law, R., Evolutionary cycling in predator-prey interactions: Population dynamics and the Red Queen (1995) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 176, pp. 91-102; Doebeli, M., Dieckmann, U., Evolutionary branching and sympatric speciation caused by different types of ecological interactions (2000) American Naturalist, 156 (SUPPL.), pp. S77-S101; Duffy, M.A., Sivars-Becker, L., Rapid evolution and ecological host-parasite dynamics (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 44-53; Gavrilets, S., Coevolutionary chase in exploiter-victim systems with polygenic characters (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 186, pp. 527-534; Hairston, N.G., Ellner, S.P., Geber, M.A., Yoshida, T., Fox, J.A., Rapid evolution and the convergence of ecological and evolutionary time (2005) Ecology Letters, 8, pp. 1114-1127; Holt, R.D., Grover, J., Tilman, D., Simple rules for interspecific dominance in systems with exploitative and apparent competition (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 741-771; Ives, A.R., Continuous-time models of host-parasitoid interactions (1992) American Naturalist, 140, pp. 1-29; Iwasa, Y., Pomiankowski, A., The evolution of costly mate preferences. 2.

Exposure of the genetic variation underlying fecundity to natural selection should therefore depend on the proportion of females both alive and pair-bonded. In spite of this, female ""marital"" status is seldom considered to impact the strength of selection on age-specific fecundity. We used marriagehistory data of preindustrial Finns who experienced conditions of natural mortality and fertility to investigate how assortative mating by age and socioeconomic status affected female fitness and underlay age-specific female marriage patterns. The probability that a female was married peaked at age 30-40 years; females who married in their early 20s to high-socioeconomic-status husbands had the highest levels of lifetime reproductive success. Greater age difference between the pair, which is typical for females who are married to highsocioeconomic-status husbands, increased the likelihood of widowhood occurring premenopause, adding to declines in the proportion of genetic variation exposed to selection with age. Using the age schedule of female marriage, we present an indicator of selection intensity on within-pair-bond fecundity. Our results suggest that the decline in selection intensity after age 30 years is a factor in the evolutionary maintenance of female reproductive senescence and menopause. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Biparental; Marriage; Monogamy; Senescence; Sensitivity; Widowhood","age at marriage; age class; assortative mating; evolutionary biology; fecundity; female; fitness; genetic variation; monogamy; mortality; natural selection; pair bond; reproductive cycle; reproductive success; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic status; survival; adult; age; article; female; fertility; genetic selection; human; longevity; male; marriage; reproduction; sexual behavior; socioeconomics; Adult; Age Factors; Female; Fertility; Humans; Longevity; Male; Marital Status; Reproduction; Selection, Genetic; Sexual Behavior; Socioeconomic Factors; Animalia",,,,,,"Alvergne, A., Lummaa, V., Does the contraceptive pill alter mate choice in humans?

Our model shows that when the benefit of having an altruistic leader decays with time, leaders will eventually emerge and will emerge later (i) in larger groups, (ii) when the cost of leadership increases, and (iii) when the assessment interval increases. The model applies to diverse situations in which time-decaying group benefits are obtained only after a group member assumes a leadership role at some cost to itself, including leader roles in foraging flocks and migration groups in birds and spiny lobsters and in high-risk foraging in desert ants. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Altruism; Cooperation; Game theory; Migration; Spiny lobster","altruism; ant; bird; cooperative behavior; evolutionary biology; fitness; foraging behavior; game theory; lobster; migratory population; numerical model; altruism; animal; animal behavior; article; biological model; evolution; game; population density; social dominance; Altruism; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Evolution; Game Theory; Models, Biological; Population Density; Social Dominance; Aves; Formicidae; Palinuridae",,,,,,"Andersson, M., Wallander, J., Kin selection and reciprocity in flight formation?

Using original and literature data, we tested predictions about egg size, egg number (lifetime fecundity), and body size under different parental care modes across a phylogeny of 287 insect species. Life-history theory and both comparative and intraspecific evidence from ectotherms suggest parental care should select for bigger, fewer eggs, but that allometric scaling of egg size and lifetime fecundity may depend on whether care consists of provisioning (density-dependent offspring survival) or merely guarding (density-independent offspring survival). Against expectation, egg size was indistinguishable among parental care modes, covarying only with body size. This refutes most theory of egg size evolution under parental care. Lifetime fecundity scaled differently depending on parental investment-positively under no care and guarding, as in most ectotherms, but negatively under provisioning. Reproductive allocation in provisioning insects resembled that in mammals and birds, also groups with obligate provisioning. We propose that the metabolic demands of multiple offspring must scale with species body size more steeply than the parent's provisioning capacity, resulting in larger females laying fewer eggs. These patterns lay the groundwork for a more general understanding of parental care and life history. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Clutch size; Density dependence; Information theory; Parental investment; Phylogenetic-comparative method; Reproductive allocation","allometry; body size; comparative study; density dependence; ectothermy; egg size; fecundity; hypothesis testing; insect; life history theory; life history trait; metabolism; parental care; phylogenetics; phylogeny; sex allocation; survival; trade-off; animal; animal behavior; article; body size; classification; clutch size; comparative study; female; fertility; histology; insect; male; oocyte; phylogeny; physiology; sexual behavior; species difference; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; Clutch Size; Female; Fertility; Insects; Male; Ovum; Phylogeny; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Species Specificity; Aves; Hexapoda; Mammalia",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.F., Combs, N., Brodie III., E.D., Insights into the costs of complex maternal care behavior in the burrower bug (Sehirus cinctus) (2005) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 57, pp. 566-574; Allainé, D., Pontier, D., Gaillard, J.M., Lebreton, J.D., Trouvilliez, J., Clobert, J., The relationship between fecundity and adult body weight in homeotherms (1987) Oecologia (Berlin), 73, pp. 478-480; Bartlett, J., Filial cannibalism in burying beetles.

Models based on Arrhenius typically assume single rate-limiting reactions over some physiological temperature range for which all the ratelimiting enzymes are in 100% active conformation. We test this assumption using data sets for microbes that have measurements of fitness (intrinsic rate of population growth) at many temperatures and over a broad temperature range and for diverse ectotherms that have measurements at fewer temperatures. When measurements are available at many temperatures, strictly Arrhenius kinetics are rejected over the physiological temperature range. However, over a narrower temperature range, we cannot reject strictly Arrhenius kinetics. The temperature range also affects estimates of the temperature dependence of fitness. These results indicate that Arrhenius kinetics only apply over a narrow range of temperatures for ectotherms, complicating attempts to identify general patterns of temperature dependence. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Arrhenius; Fitness; Temperature; Universal temperature dependence","data set; ectothermy; enzyme activity; fitness; high temperature; hypothesis testing; microorganism; numerical model; physiological response; population growth; reaction kinetics; reaction rate; temperature effect; temperature profile; alga; animal; article; bacterial phenomena and functions; biological model; insect; kinetics; physiology; plankton; population growth; species difference; temperature; thermoregulation; Algae; Animals; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Body Temperature Regulation; Insects; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Plankton; Population Growth; Species Specificity; Temperature",,,,,,"Arrhenius, S., (1915) Quantitative Laws in Biological Chemistry, , Bell, London; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information Theoretic Approach, , Springer, New York; Feller, G., Molecular adaptations to cold in psychrophilic enzymes (2003) Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, 60, pp. 648-662; Feller, G., Gerday, C., Psychrophilic enzymes: Molecular basis of cold adaptation (1997) Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, 53 (10), pp. 830-841. , DOI 10.1007/s000180050103; Fields, P.A., Review: Protein function at thermal extremes: Balancing stability and flexibility (2001) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A, 129, pp. 417-431; Fields, P.A., Kim, Y.S., Carpenter, J.F., Somero, G.N., Temperature adaptation in Gillichthys (Teleost: Gobiidae) A <sub>4</sub>lactate dehydrogenases: Identical primary structures produce subtly different conformations (2002) Journal of Experimental Biology, 205, pp. 1293-1303; Frazier, M.R., Huey, R.B., Berrigan, D., Thermodynamics constrains the evolution of insect population growth rates: ""Warmer is better.""

The proportion of all young that are EPY varies across populations and species. Because an EPC that does not result in EPY leaves no forensic trace, this variation in the proportion of EPY reflects both variation in the tendency to engage in EPC and variation in the extrapair fertilization (EPF) process across populations and species. We analyzed data on the distribution of EPY in broods of four passerines (blue tit, great tit, collared flycatcher, and pied flycatcher), with 18,564 genotyped nestlings from 2,346 broods in two to nine populations per species. Our Bayesian modeling approach estimated the underlying probability function of EPC (assumed to be a Poisson function) and conditional binomial EPF probability. We used an information theoretical approach to show that the expected distribution of EPC per female varies across populations but that EPF probabilities vary on the above-species level (tits vs. flycatchers). Hence, for these four passerines, our model suggests that the probability of an EPC mainly is determined by ecological (population-specific) conditions, whereas EPF probabilities reflect processes that are fixed above the species level. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bird; Extrapair paternity; Mate choice; Mating systems; Promiscuity; Sexual selection","Bayesian analysis; comparative study; data interpretation; extra-pair copulation; mate choice; nestling; numerical model; passerine; reproductive strategy; sexual selection; animal; article; Bayes theorem; comparative study; female; genetics; genotype; male; physiology; population dynamics; sexual behavior; songbird; species difference; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Female; Genotype; Male; Passeriformes; Population Dynamics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Species Specificity; Animalia; Aves; Passeriformes",,,,,,"Arnold, K.E., Owens, I.P.F., Extra-pair paternity and egg dumping in birds: Life history, parental care and the risk of retaliation (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 269, pp. 1263-1269; Bennett, P.M., Owens, I.P.F., (2002) Evolutionary Ecology of Birds: Life History, Mating Systems and Extinction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Birkhead, T.R., Sperm competition in birds: Mechanism and function (1998) Sperm Competition and Sexual Selection, pp. 579-622. , in T.

The source of selection driving the evolution of these proteins is still debated. It has been suggested that sexual conflict can result in proliferation of genetic variation and possibly linkage disequilibrium between sperm and egg proteins. Empirical evidence suggests that both male and female reproductive success can be predicted by their sperm ligand genotype, but why female success can be predicted by a protein expressed only in males is unknown. Here we use mathematical modeling to investigate the interaction between reproductive behavior and sperm availability on the evolution of sperm ligands and egg receptors. We consider haploid and diploid expression in gametes in two possible ecological scenarios, monogamous spawning and competitive spawning. Reproductive behavior plays an important role in determining possible outcomes resulting from sexual conflict. Sperm limitation selects for common genotypes regardless of mating behavior. Under conditions of sperm abundance, competitive spawning provides conditions for the persistence of allelic variation and gametic disequilibrium. With monogamous spawning, such conditions are more restrictive. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bindin; Gametic disequilibrium; Polymorphism; Polyspermy; Sexual conflict","cell adhesion molecule; cell surface receptor; evolutionary biology; gamete; gene expression; genetic variation; genotype; protein; reproductive behavior; reproductive success; sexual conflict; sperm; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; female; fertility; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic selection; genetics; male; metabolism; molecular evolution; oocyte; physiology; sexual behavior; spermatozoon; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Computer Simulation; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Gene Frequency; Linkage Disequilibrium; Male; Models, Biological; Ovum; Receptors, Cell Surface; Selection, Genetic; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Sperm-Ovum Interactions; Spermatozoa",,"Cell Adhesion Molecules; Receptors, Cell Surface",,,,"Bode, M., Marshall, D.J., The quick and the dead?

Yet, the explanation for this hump-shaped diversity pattern has remained unclear because no studies have addressed both the ecological and evolutionary causes. Here, we address these causes in North American plethodontid salamanders, using a near-comprehensive phylogeny and environmental data. We develop a null model for assessing the relationship between the time that an area has been occupied and its species richness, and we apply a new approach that tests whether clades exhibit long-term stasis in their climatic niches (niche conservatism). Evolutionary, the midelevation peak in species richness is explained by the time-for-speciation effect, with intermediate-elevation habitats seemingly being inhabited longest and accumulating more species. We find that this pattern is associated with evolutionary stasis in species' climatic niches, driving the midelevation peak by constraining the dispersal of lineages to environments at lower and higher elevations. These processes may help explain elevational diversity patterns in many montane regions around the world. The results also suggest that montane biotas may harbor high levels of'both species diversity and phylogenetic diversity but may be particularly susceptible to rapid climate change. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Climate; Elevation; Niche conservatism; Phylogeny; Speciation; Species richness","amphibian; cladistics; climate change; elevation; mountain region; niche partitioning; phylogeny; speciation (biology); species diversity; species richness; adaptation; altitude; Amphibia; animal; article; biodiversity; ecosystem; geography; phylogeny; physiology; theoretical model; time; United States; Adaptation, Biological; Altitude; Animals; Appalachian Region; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Phylogeny; Time Factors; Urodela; Animalia; Plethodon jordani; Plethodontidae; Salamandroidea",,,,,,"Anderson, J., Tilley, S.G., Systematics of the Desmognathus ochrophaeus complex in the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee (2003) Herpetological Monographs, 17, pp. 75-110; Anthony, C.D., Wicknick, J.A., Jaeger, R.G., Social interactions in two sympatric plethodontid salamanders: Effectiveness of a highly aggressive strategy (1997) Behaviour, 134, pp. 71-88; Arif, S., Wicknick, J.A., Adams, D.C., Bioclimatic modeling, morphology, and behavior reveal alternative mechanisms regulating the distributions of two parapatric salamander species (2007) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9, pp. 843-854; Bernardo, J., Spotila, J., Physiological constraints on organismal response to global warming: Mechanistic insights from clinally varying populations and implications for assessing endangerment (2006) Biology Letters, 2, pp. 135-139; Bernardo, J., Ossola, R.J., Spotila, J., Crandall, K.A., Interspecies physiological variation as a tool for cross-species assessments of global warming-induced endangerment: Validation of an intrinsic determinant of macroecological and phylogeographic structure (2007) Biology Letters, 3, pp. 695-699; Butler, M.A., King, A.A., Phylogenetic comparative analysis: A modeling approach for adaptive evolution (2004) American Naturalist, 164, pp. 683-695; Camp, C.D., Peterman, W.E., Milanovich, J.R., Lamb, T., Maerz, J.C., Wake, D.B., A new genus and species of lungless salamander (family Plethodontidae) from the Appalachian highlands of the southeastern United States (2009) Journal of Zoology (London), 279, pp. 86-94; Colwell, R.K., Hurtt, G.C., Nonbiological gradients in species richness and a spurious Rapoport effect (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 570-595; Crandall, K.A., Buhay, J.E., Global diversity of crayfish (Astacidae, Cambaridae, and Parasticidae-Decapoda) in freshwater (2008) Hydrobiologia, 595, pp. 295-301; Duellman, W.E., Sweet, S.S., Distribution patterns of amphibians in the Nearctic region of North America (1999) Patterns of Distribution of Amphibians, p. 31109. , in W E.

Our approach is novel in three ways. First, we applied a deterministic evolutionary modeling system that allows a large number of alternative mimetic morphs to coexist and compete. Second, we considered that there may be natural boundaries to phenotypic expression. Finally, we allowed increasing conspicuousness to impose an increasing detection cost on mimics. In some instances, the model predicts widespread variation in mimetic forms at evolutionary stability. In other situations, rather than a polymorphism the model predicts dimorphisms in which some prey were maximally cryptic and had minimal resemblance to the model, whereas many others were more conspicuous than the model. The biological implications of these results, particularly for our understanding of imperfect mimicry, are discussed. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Batesian mimicry; Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS); Polymorphism; Signal detection","antipredator defense; evolutionarily stable strategy; mimicry; phenotype; polymorphism; adaptation; animal; animal communication; article; computer simulation; evolution; genetic selection; phenotype; physiology; theoretical model; Adaptation, Biological; Animal Communication; Animals; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Models, Theoretical; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",,,,,,"Blows, T.R., Wimmer, B.J., A simple mathematical model for Batesian mimicry (2005) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, 2005 (1), pp. 87-92. , DOI 10.1155/DDNS.2005.87; Charlesworth, D., Charlesworth, B., Theoretical genetics of Batesian mimicry. 1.

We investigated this hypothesis with an individual-based model tailored to the biology of guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We specifically modeled the situation where a high-predation population below a waterfall colonizes a low-predation population above a waterfall. Focusing on the evolution of male color, we confirm that divergent selection causes the appreciable evolution of male color within 20 generations. The rate and magnitude of this divergence were reduced when dispersal rates were high and when female choice did not differ between environments. Adaptive divergence was always coupled to the evolution of two reproductive barriers: viability selection against immigrants and hybrids. Different types of sexual selection, however, led to contrasting results for another potential reproductive barrier: mating success of immigrants. In some cases, the effects of natural and sexual selection offset each other, leading to no overall reproductive isolation despite strong adaptive divergence. Sexual selection acting through female choice can thus strongly modify the effects of divergent natural selection and thereby alter the standard predictions of ecological speciation. We also found that under no circumstances did divergent selection cause appreciable divergence in neutral genetic markers. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive divergence; Ecological speciation;

Although most animals are able to distinguish acoustic signals of their own species from other sympatrically occurring species, it is yet unknown whether animals can distinguish among acoustic signals of different closely related sympatric species. In this context, echolocating bats are a particularly interesting model system: their echolocation system evolved primarily for spatial orientation and foraging, but recent studies indicate that echolocation also has an important communicative function. Yet, the role of echolocation calls for species discrimination and thus potentially for interspecific communication has not been investigated. Using a behavioral discrimination assay, we found that two species of wild horseshoe bats could discriminate calls of their own species from those of three sympatric congeneric species. We further show that the bats were able to discriminate between echolocation calls of different congeneric species from the local community. In both cases, discrimination ability was high despite strong overlap of species' call frequency bands. This study provides the first experimental evidence for species discrimination based on echolocation calls. On a more general level, it shows for the first time that animals can distinguish among acoustic signals of different closely related and ecologically similar species from their local community. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bats; Communication; Community ecology; Echolocation; Species discrimination; Vocal signature","auditory cue; bat; behavioral ecology; bioassay; echolocation; foraging behavior; orientation behavior; relatedness; sympatry; animal; animal communication; article; auditory stimulation; bat; Bulgaria; echolocation; pattern recognition; perceptive discrimination; physiology; species difference; Acoustic Stimulation; Animal Communication; Animals; Bulgaria; Chiroptera; Discrimination (Psychology); Echolocation; Pattern Recognition, Physiological; Species Specificity; Animalia; Rhinolophus",,,,,,"Barber, J.R., Chadwell, B.A., Garrett, N., Schmidt-French, B., Conner, W.E., Naive bats discriminate arctiid moth warning sounds but generalize their aposematic meaning (2009) Journal of Experimental Biology, 212, pp. 2141-2148; Barclay, R.M.R., Interindividual use of echolocation calls: Eavesdropping by bats (1982) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 10, pp. 271-275; Bats are not birds-a cautionary note on using echolocation calls to identify bats: A comment (1999) Journal of Mammalogy, 80, pp. 290-296; Barth, F.G., Sensory guidance in spider pre-copulatory behavior (1993) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A, 104, pp. 717-733; Blumstein, D.T., Cooley, L., Winternitz, J., Daniel, J.C., Do yellow-bellied marmots respond to predator vocalizations?

Several measures are based on extrapolation from species specialized to tropical rain forest, each using specific assumptions and justifications. These approaches have not provided any sound measure of uncertainty associated with richness estimates. We present two models that account for parameter uncertainty by replacing point estimates with probability distributions. The models predict medians of 3.7 million and 2.5 million tropical arthropod species globally, with 90% confidence intervals of [2.0, 7.4] million and [1.1, 5.4] million, respectively. Estimates of 30 million or greater are predicted to have <0.00001 probability. Sensitivity analyses identified uncertainty in the proportion of canopy arthropod species that are beetles as the most influential parameter, although uncertainties associated with three other parameters were also important. Using the median estimates suggests that in spite of 250 years of taxonomy and around 855,000 species of arthropods already described, approximately 70% await description. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Coleoptera; Global richness estimate; Host specificity; Latin hypercube sampling; Stochastic model; Tropical rain forest insects","arthropod; forest ecosystem; host specificity; probability; rainforest; species richness; taxonomy; tropical forest; uncertainty analysis; animal; arthropod; article; biodiversity; physiology; probability; sensitivity and specificity; theoretical model; tropic climate; uncertainty; Animals; Arthropods; Biodiversity; Models, Theoretical; Probability; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tropical Climate; Uncertainty; Arthropoda; Coleoptera; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Buckland, S.T., Monte Carlo confidence intervals (1984) Biometrics, 40, pp. 811-817; Burgman, M., (2005) Risks and Decisions for Conservation and Environmental Management, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Chapman, A.D., Numbers of living species in Australia and the world (2009) Australian Biological Resources Study, , http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/ species-numbers/2009/pubs/nlsaw-2nd-complete.pdf, 2nd ed.

One key prediction is that the relative benefits of dispersal should be greater when dispersing away from close relatives, because in this case dispersal has the additional benefit of alleviating competition with individuals who share the same dispersal alleles. We tested this prediction for the first time using experimental populations of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We measured the fitness of isogenic genotypes that differed only in their dispersal behaviors in both clonal and mixed populations. Consistent with theory, the benefit of dispersal was much higher in clonal populations, and this benefit decreased with increasing growth rate costs associated with dispersal. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bacteria; Experimental evolution; Kin selection; Type IV pili; Virulence","allele; bacterium; clonal organism; dispersal; fitness; genotype; intraspecific competition; kin selection; pathogen; virulence; article; demography; evolution; genetic fitness; pathogenicity; physiology; population density; population dynamics; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; virulence; Demography; Evolution; Genetic Fitness; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Virulence; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas aeruginosa",,,,,,"Bai, F., Li, Y., Xu, H., Xia, H., Yin, T., Yao, H., Zhang, L., Identification and functional characterization of pfm, a novel gene involved in swimming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2007) Gene, 401, pp. 19-27; Bengtsson, B.O., Avoiding inbreeding: At what cost?

Autocorrelation analysis of aerial photographs revealed that diatoms occur in regularly spaced patterns consisting of elevated hummocks alternating with water-filled hollows. Hummocks were characterized by high diatom content and a high sediment erosion threshold, while both were low in hollows. These results highlight the interaction between diatom growth and sedimentary processes as a potential mechanism for spatial patterning. Several alternative mechanisms could be excluded as important mechanisms in the formation of spatial patterns. We developed a spatially explicit mathematical model that revealed that scale-dependent interactions between sedimentation, diatom growth, and water redistribution explain the observed patterns. The model predicts that areas exhibiting spatially selforganized patterns have increased sediment accretion and diatom biomass compared with areas lacking spatial patterns, a prediction confirmed by empirical evidence. Our study on intertidal mudflats provides a simple but clear-cut example of how the interaction between biological and sedimentary processes, through the process of self-organization, induces spatial patterns at a landscape level. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Biogeomorphology; Diatom; Ecosystem functioning; Scale-dependent feedback mechanisms; Sediment; Westerschelde","accretion; aerial photograph; autocorrelation; biomass; biophysics; diatom; ecosystem function; environmental stress; feedback mechanism; growth rate; landscape ecology; mudflat; sediment transport; sedimentation; spatial distribution; article; biological model; computer simulation; demography; diatom; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; sediment; water flow; wetland; Computer Simulation; Demography; Diatoms; Ecosystem; Geologic Sediments; Models, Biological; Water Movements; Wetlands; Bacillariophyta",,,,,,"Austen, I., Andersen, T.J., Edelvang, K., The influence of benthic diatoms and invertebrates on the erodibility of an intertidal mudflat, the Danish Wadden Sea (1999) Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 49 (1), pp. 99-111. , DOI 10.1006/ecss.1998.0491; Bassoullet, P., Le Hir, P., Gouleau, D., Robert, S., Sediment transport over an intertidal mudflat: Field investigations and estimation of fluxes within the ""Baie de Marennes-Oleron"" (France) (2000) Continental Shelf Research, 20, pp. 1635-1653; Blanchard, G.F., Paterson, D.M., Stal, L.J., Richard, P., Galois, R., Huet, V., Kelly, J., The effect of geomorphological structures on potential biostabilisation by microphytobenthos on intertidal mudflats (2000) Continental Shelf Research, 20, pp. 1243-1256; Borsje, B.W., De Vries, M.B., Huscher, S., De Boer, G.J., Modeling large-scale cohesive sediment transport affected by small-scale biological activity (2008) Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science, 78, pp. 468-480; Champneys, A.R., Homoclinic orbits in reversible systems and their applications in mechanics, fluids and optics (1996) Physica D, 112, pp. 158-186; Couteron, P., Lejeune, O., Periodic spotted patterns in semi-arid vegetation explained by a propagation-inhibition model (2001) Journal of Ecology, 89 (4), pp. 616-628. , DOI 10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00588.x; Crawley, M.J., (2005) The R Book, , Wiley, Chichester; D'Alpaos, A., Lanzoni, S., Marani, M., Rinaldo, A., Landscape evolution in tidal embayments: Modeling the interplay of erosion, sedimentation, and vegetation dynamics (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research F: Earth Surface, 112 (1), pp. F01008. , DOI 10.1029/2006JF000537; De Boer, P.L., Mechanical effects of micro-organisms on intertidal bedform migration (1981) Sedimentology, 28, pp. 129-132; De Brouwer, J.F.C., Bjelic, S., De Deckere, E., Stal, L.J., Interplay between biology and sedimentology in a mudflat (Biezelingse Ham, Westerschelde, the Netherlands) (2000) Continental Shelf Research, 20, pp. 1159-1177; De Jonge, V.N., Van Beusekom, J.E.E., Contribution of resuspended microphytobenthos to total phytoplankton in the EMS estuary and its possible role for grazers (1992) Netherlands Journal of Sea Research, 30, pp. 91-105; Doedel, E.J., Paffenroth, R.C., Champneys, A., Fairgrieve, T.F., Kuznetsov, Y.A., Oldman, B.E., Sandstede, B., Wang, X., (2001) AUTO 2000: Continuation and Bifurcation Software for Ordinary Differential Equations (With HOMCONT), , http://indy.cs.concordia.ca/auto/, Technical report.

Determining the mechanisms underlying these patterns is difficult because lighting environments can have multiple effects on signaling that occur at multiple timescales. Lighting environments can (1) immediately affect signal propagation and transmission, which determine the radiance spectrum reaching the receiver; (2) induce variation in visual systems via developmental plasticity; and (3) lead to genetic differences in visual systems due to a history of selection in different habitats. We tease apart these effects on pecking preference and examine the relationship between pecking preference and opsin expression. Using killifish from two visually distinct populations (clear vs. tea-stained water), we performed crosses (genetics), raised animals under different lighting conditions (developmental plasticity), and assayed the preference to peck at different-colored dots under different lighting conditions (immediate effects). Pecks are interpreted as foraging preference. Developmental plasticity affected both pecking preference and opsin expression. Lighting environments also had immediate effects on pecking preference, but these depended on the lighting conditions animals experienced during development. Genetic effects were detected in opsin expression, but there were no corresponding effects on pecking preference. Overall, only 3.36% of the variation in pecking preference was accounted for by opsin expression. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Color vision; Developmental plasticity; Phenotypic plasticity; Sensory bias; Sensory drive; Visual ecology","opsin; color; developmental biology; foraging behavior; genetic variation; light effect; phenotypic plasticity; protein; signaling; teleost; vision; animal; appetite; article; color vision; cross breeding; Cyprinodontiformes; decision making; feeding behavior; genetics; light; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Choice Behavior; Color Vision; Crosses, Genetic; Feeding Behavior; Fundulidae; Light; Opsins; Animalia; Cyprinodontiformes; Cyprinodontoidei; Lucania goodei",,"Opsins",,,,"Allison, W.T., Haimberger, T.J., Hawryshyn, C.W., Temple, S.E., Visual pigment composition in zebrafish: Evidence for a rhodopsin-porphyropsin interchange system (2004) Visual Neuroscience, 21, pp. 945-952; Allison, W.T., Dann, S.G., Veldhoen, K.M., Hawryshyn, C.W., Degeneration and regeneration of ultraviolet cone photoreceptors during development in rainbow trout (2006) Journal of Comparative Neurology, 499, pp. 702-715; Bennett, A.T.D., Cuthill, I.C., Norris, K.J., Sexual selection and the mismeasure of color (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 848-860; Boughman, J.W., Divergent sexual selection enhances reproductive isolation in sticklebacks (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 944-948; How sensory drive can promote speciation (2002) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 17, pp. 571-577; Bowmaker, J.K., Evolution of vertebrate visual pigments (2008) Vision Research, 48, pp. 2022-2041; Carleton, K.L., Kocher, T.D., Cone opsin genes of African cichlid fishes: Tuning spectral sensitivity by differential gene expression (2001) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 18, pp. 1540-1550; Carleton, K.L., Spady, T.C., Streelman, J.T., Kidd, M.R., McFarland, W.N., Loew, E.R., Visual sensitivities tuned by heterochronic shifts in opsin gene expression (2008) BMC Biology, 6, p. 22; Cheroske, A.G., Cronin, T.W., Caldwell, R.L., Adaptive color vision in Pullosquilla litoralis (Stomatopoda, Lysiosquilloidea) associated with spectral and intensity changes in light environment (2003) Journal of Experimental Biology, 206, pp. 373-379; Cheroske, A.G., Barber, P.H., Cronin, T.W., Evolutionary variation in the expression of phenotypically plastic color vision in Caribbean mantis shrimps genus Neogonodactylus (2006) Marine Biology, 150, pp. 213-220; Cronin, T.W., Caldwell, R.L., Tuning of photoreceptor function in three mantis shrimp species that inhabit a range of depths.

To understand their ultimate signaling functions, it is important to identify the proximate mechanism promoting variation in coloration. Carotenoid-based colors combine structural and pigmentary components, but the importance of the contribution of structural components to variation in pigment-based colors (i.e., carotenoid-based colors) has been undervalued. In a field experiment with great tits (Parus major), we combined a brood size manipulation with a simultaneous carotenoid supplementation in order to disentangle the effects of carotenoid availability and early growth condition on different components of the yellow breast feathers. By defining independent measures of feather carotenoid content (absolute carotenoid chroma) and background structure (background reflectance), we demonstrate that environmental factors experienced during the nestling period, namely, early growth conditions and carotenoid availability, contribute independently to variation in yellow plumage coloration. While early growth conditions affected the background reflectance of the plumage, the availability of carotenoids affected the absolute carotenoid chroma, the peak of maximum ultraviolet reflectance, and the overall shape, that is, chromatic information of the reflectance curves. These findings demonstrate that environmentinduced variation in background structure contributes significantly to intraspecific variation in yellow carotenoid-based plumage coloration. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Carotenoid-based color; Parus major; Structural color","carotenoid; brood size; carotenoid; color; environmental conditions; environmental factor; experimental study; intraspecific variation; nestling; passerine; plumage; signaling; animal; animal communication; article; color; computer simulation; feather; histology; metabolism; physiology; pigmentation; songbird; Switzerland; ultraviolet radiation; Animal Communication; Animals; Carotenoids; Color; Computer Simulation; Feathers; Passeriformes; Pigmentation; Switzerland; Ultraviolet Rays; Parus major",,"Carotenoids, 36-88-4",,,,"Andersson, S., Prager, M., Quantifying colors (2006) Bird Coloration, 1, p. 4189. , in G.

In particular, it is important to understand the processes that generate and maintain variation. Here, we examine a coevolutionary model of hosts and parasites where infection does not depend on absolute rates of transmission and defense but is approximately all-or-nothing, depending on the relative levels of defense and infectivity of the host and the parasite. We show that considerable diversity can be generated and maintained because of epidemiological feedbacks, with strains differing in the range of host and parasite types they can respectively infect or resist. Parasites with broad and narrow ranges therefore coexist, as do broadly and narrowly resistant hosts, but this diversity occurs without the assumption of highly specific gene interactions. In contrast to gene-for-gene models, cycling in strain types is found only under a restrictive set of circumstances. The generation of diversity in both hosts and parasites is dependent on the shape of the trade-off relationships but is more likely in long-lived hosts and chronic disease with long infectious periods. Overall, our model shows that significant diversity in infectivity and resistance range can evolve and be maintained from initially monomorphic populations. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive dynamics; Coevolution; Genetic variation; Infection range","coevolution; coexistence; epidemiology; evolutionary biology; genetic variation; host-parasite interaction; infectivity; trade-off; adaptation; animal; animal parasitosis; article; biodiversity; biological model; computer simulation; disease transmission; evolution; genetic variability; genetics; host parasite interaction; physiology; species difference; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Biodiversity; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Genetic Variation; Host-Parasite Interactions; Models, Biological; Parasitic Diseases, Animal; Species Specificity",,,,,,"Adler, F.R., Mosquera, J., Is space necessary? interference competition and limits to biodiversity (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 3226-3232; Agrawal, A., Lively, C.M., Infection genetics: Gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models and all points in between (2002) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 4 (1), pp. 79-90; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., The population dynamics of microparasites and their invertebrate hosts (1981) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 291, pp. 451-524; Bergelson, J., Kreitman, M., Stahl, E.A., Tian, D., Evolutionary dynamics of plant A-genes (2001) Science, 292, pp. 2281-2285; Best, A., White, A., Boots, M., The implications of coevolutionary dynamics to host-parasite interactions (2009) American Naturalist, 173, pp. 779-791; Bevan, J.R., Clarke, D.D., Crute, I.R., Resistance to Erisyphe fischeri in two populations of Senecio vulgaris (1993) Plant Pathology, 42, pp. 636-646; Boots, M., Bowers, R.G., Three mechanisms of host resistance to microparasites-avoidance, recovery and toleranceshow different evolutionary dynamics (1999) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 201, pp. 13-23; The evolution of resistance through costly acquired immunity (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 715-723; Boots, M., Haraguchi, Y., The evolution of costly resistance in host-parasite systems (1999) American Naturalist, 153 (4), pp. 359-370. , DOI 10.1086/303181; Bowers, R.G., Boots, M., Begon, M., Life-history tradeoffs and the evolution of pathogen resistance: Competition between host strains (1994) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 257, pp. 247-253; Bowers, R.G., Hoyle, A., White, A., Boots, M., The geometric theory of adaptive evolution: Trade-off and invasion plots (2005) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 233, pp. 363-377; Bremermann, H.J., Pickering, J., A game-theoretical model of parasite virulence (1983) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 100, pp. 411-426; Brockhurst, M.A., Rainey, P.B., Buckling, A., The effect of spatial heterogeneity and parasites on the evolution of host diversity (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 107-111; Buckling, A., Rainey, P.B., Antagonistic coevolution between a bacterium and a bacteriophage (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 269, pp. 931-936; Buckling, A., Wei, Y., Massey, R.C., Brockhurst, M.A., Hochberg, M.E., Antagonistic coevolution with parasites increases the cost of host deleterious mutations (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273 (1582), pp. 45-49. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2005.3279; Burdon, J.J., Thrall, P.H., Brown, A.H.D., Resistance and virulence structure in two Linum marginale-Melampsora Uni hostpathogen metapopulations with different mating systems (1999) Evolution, 53, pp. 704-716; Chao, L., Levin, B.R., Stewart, F.M., A complex community in a simple habitat: An experimental study with bacteria and phage (1977) Ecology, 58, pp. 369-378; Cleaveland, S., Laurenson, M.K., Taylor, L.H., Diseases of humans and their domestic mammals: Pathogen characteristics, host range and the risk of emergence (2001) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 356 (1411), pp. 991-999. , DOI 10.1098/rstb.2001.0889; De Mazancourt, C., Dieckmann, U., Trade-off geometries and frequency-dependent selection (2004) American Naturalist, 164, p. 765778; Dieckmann, U., Law, R., The dynamical theory of coevolution: A derivation from stochastic ecological processes (1996) Journal of Mathematical Biology, 34, pp. 579-612; Dieckmann, U., Metz, J.A.J., Surprising evolutionary predictions from enhanced ecological realism (2006) Theoretical Population Biology, 69, pp. 263-281; Dieckmann, U., Marrow, P., Law, R., Evolutionary cycling in predator-prey interactions: Population dynamics and the Red Queen (1995) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 176, pp. 91-102; (2002) Adaptive Dynamics of Pathogen-host Interactions, , Dieckmann, U., J.

Tactical use of false positive signals has thus been documented mainly where interests are consistently opposed, such as between predator and prey and between competitors for food and for mates. Here we report that male topi antelopes alarm snort deceptively to retain receptive females in their territories and thereby secure mating opportunities. The finding reveals that sexual conflict over mating, which is known to promote various forms of coercion and sensory bias exploitation, can also lead to active signal falsification. However, because honesty in sexual signals is generally assured by physical or cost-enforced constraints on signal production, sexually selected mate deception is likely to target mainly signals, such as alarm calls, that were originally not under sexual selection. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Deception; Sexual conflict; Sexual selection; Sperm competition","alarm signal; communication behavior; honest signaling; life history trait; mating behavior; ruminant; sexual selection; sperm competition; animal; antelope; article; female; Kenya; male; observation; physiology; recumbency; sexual behavior; territoriality; vocalization; Animals; Antelopes; Deception; Female; Kenya; Male; Observation; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Territoriality; Vocalization, Animal; Animalia; Damaliscus lunatus",,,,,,"Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bro-Jorgensen, J., Overt female mate competition and preference for central males in a lekking antelope (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 99 (14), pp. 9290-9293. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.142125899; Reversed sexual conflict in a promiscuous antelope (2007) Current Biology, 17, pp. 2157-2161; Byrne, R.W., Corp, N., Neocortex size predicts deception rate in primates (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 1693-1699; Caldwell, R.L., The deceptive use of reputation by stomatopods Pages 129-145 (1986) Deception: Perspectives on Human and Nonhuman Deceit, , R.

A lack of habitat matching, where species distributions do not correspond to environmental variability, suggests neutrality but can also be explained by niche models through the interactions of dispersal limitation, spatial autocorrelation of the environment, species interactions, and spatial scale. We untangle these effects in a field study with multiscale statistical analyses. We demonstrate that despite significant niche-based environmental responses by a savanna plant, we still see weak habitat matching, with the mechanisms responsible differing by spatial scale. At the coarse scale (100-200 m), dispersal limitation restricted the occupation of optimal habitat. At the fine scale (<30 m), dispersal was not limiting, but a lack of autocorrelation of environmental variables prevented the aggregation of reproductively active plants in optimal microsites. Species associations were largely unimportant at all scales. Extending our analysis to the entire community revealed similar scale-dependent limitations of distance and the environment, indicating weak habitat matching for all species. This work supports predictions that environmental specializations do not necessarily produce deterministic distributions in plant communities. It also provides a mechanistic explanation for why co-occurring plant species can have largely undifferentiated distributions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Dispersal limitation; Environmental specialization;

Here we use body mass data from 3,473 of 4,510 extant mammalian species and an almost complete species-level phylogeny to determine the best model of log(body mass) evolution across all mammals, split taxonomically and spatially. An early-burst model fits better across all mammals than do models based on either Brownian motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, suggesting that mammals experienced a burst of morphological evolution relatively early in their history that was followed by slower change. We also use spatial models to investigate rates of body mass evolution within ecoregions. These models show that around 50% of the variation in rate can be explained by just a few predictors. High estimated rates are associated with cold, low-lying, species-poor, high-energy, mainland ecoregions. We conclude that the evolution of mammalian body size has been influenced by a complex interplay among geography, climate, and history. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Body mass; Brownian; Early burst; Mammals; OU; Rates of evolution","body mass; body size; Brownian motion; ecoregion; life history theory; macroecology; mammal; morphology; phylogeny; temporal evolution; animal; article; biological model; body size; comparative study; evolution; genetics; growth, development and aging; mammal; Animals; Body Size; Evolution; Mammals; Models, Genetic; Mammalia",,,,,,"Adams, D.C., Berns, C.M., Kozak, K.H., Weins, J.J., Are rates of species diversification correlated with rates of morphological evolution?

In a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), field experiments have shown that exogenous testosterone alters individuals' resolution of the survival-reproduction trade-off, enhancing reproduction at the expense of survival. Here we used standardized injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to assay variation in the testosterone production of males. Using measurements of annual survival and reproduction, we found evidence of strong natural selection acting on GnRH-induced increases in testosterone. Opposite to what would be predicted from the survival-reproduction trade-off, patterns of selection via survival and reproduction were remarkably similar. Males with GnRH -induced testosterone production levels that were slightly above the population mean were more likely to survive and also produced more offspring, leading to strong stabilizing selection. Partitioning reproduction into separate components revealed positive directional selection via within-pair siring success and stabilizing selection via extrapair mating success.

Brief periods of food deprivation are often followed by a period of accelerated (compensatory) growth. Early laboratory studies likewise reported a contraction of genetic variance in size as maturation approached. However, studies of wild populations often contradict these laboratory results. One possibility is that environmentally imposed stress is exposing genetic variance not seen in the laboratory. We tested the effect of rearing environment (high or low food) on genetic variance in size traits measured at two ages in the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis. A substantial amount of genetic variance was present in all combinations of rearing environment by ontogenetic stage among males. The pattern of change in male variance in mass over ontogeny was of opposite sign in the two food treatments, which may reflect cryptic genetic variance that is apparent only under stress. The proportion of overall variance that was due to additive genetic effects was much lower in females than in males, which suggests that the underlying genetics of female growth trajectories differs from that males. Our experimental design afforded an initial exploration of the genetics of compensatory growth. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Canalization; Compensatory growth; G × E; Mutational; Ontogeny; Quantitative genetics; Target size","beetle; canalization (biology); crypsis; environmental change; food limitation; genetic variation; growth rate; mutation; ontogeny; size at maturity; wild population; animal; article; beetle; biological model; body size; comparative study; environment; female; genetic variability; genetics; growth, development and aging; larva; male; Animals; Beetles; Body Size; Environment; Female; Genetic Variation; Larva; Male; Models, Genetic; Coccinellidae; Coleoptera; Harmonia axyridis",,,,,,"Ali, M., Nicieza, A., Wootton, R.J., Compensatory growth in fishes: A response to growth depression (2003) Fish and Fisheries, 4 (2), pp. 147-190. , DOI 10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00120.x; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Arendt, J.D., Adaptive intrinsic growth rates: An integration across taxa (1997) Quarterly Review of Biology, 72 (2), pp. 149-177; Atchley, W.R., Ontogeny, timing of development, and genetic variance-covariance structure (1984) American Naturalist, 123, pp. 519-540; Atchley, W.R., Zhu, J., Developmental quantitative genetics, conditional epigenetic variability and growth in mice (1997) Genetics, 147, pp. 765-776; Charlesworth, B., (1994) Evolution in Age-structured Populations, , 2nd ed.

Here we tested whether proactive personalities (high levels of activity, boldness, and aggression) are related to a fast ""pace of life"" (high rates of growth, mortality, and energy expenditure). Data from the literature provide preliminary evidence that artificial selection on dogs (through domestication) generated variations in personality traits that are correlated with life histories and metabolism. We found that obedient (or docile, shy) breeds live longer than disobedient (or bold) ones and that aggressive breeds have higher energy needs than unaggressive ones. These correlations could result from either human preference for particular trait combinations or, more likely, correlated responses to artificial selection on personality. Our results suggest the existence of a general pace-of-life syndrome arising from the coevolution of personality, metabolic, and life-history traits. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Activity; Aggression; Correlated change; Correlational selection; Docility; Life-history traits","activity pattern; aggression; body size; canid; domestication; growth rate; life history trait; longevity; animal; animal behavior; breeding; dog; energy metabolism; genetic selection; human; longevity; physiology; psychological aspect; review; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Breeding; Dogs; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Longevity; Selection, Genetic; Canis familiaris",,,,,,"Adriaenssens, B., Johnsson, J.I., Personality and life-history productivity: Consistent or variable association?

The optimal allocation strategy can change, depending on the amount of resources available to allocate to life-history functions. If so, selection should favor the evolution of allocation strategies that can respond to variation in environmental resource levels. We address this issue by using two quantitative genetic simulation models in a model system for studying trade-offs, wing-dimorphic insects. Wing dimorphic insects typically exhibit a trade-off in the allocation of resources between migratory ability and reproduction. In our models, we focus on allocation as a genetic trait and model the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in this trait in response to spatiotemporal variation in resource availability. We show that the evolved allocation strategy depends on the predictability of resource levels across time. Specifically, selection favors higher investment in flight under poor conditions in predictable environments and lower investment in unpredictable environments. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Allocation; Environmental predictability; Migration; Phenotypic plasticity; Wing dimorphism","dimorphism; flight; insect; life history trait; migration; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive productivity; resource allocation; resource availability; simulation; spatial variation; temporal variation; trade-off; wing; animal; article; biological model; evolution; forelimb; genetics; insect; phenotype; population migration; reproduction; Animal Migration; Animals; Evolution; Insects; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Reproduction; Wing; Hexapoda",,,,,,"Alexander, R.D., Life cycle origins, speciation, and related phenomena in crickets (1968) Quarterly Review of Biology, 43, pp. 1-41; Bashey, F., Cross-generational environmental effects and the evolution of offspring size in the trinidadian guppy poecilia reticulata (2006) Evolution, 60 (2), pp. 348-361. , http://evol.allenpress.com/pdfserv/i0014-3820-060-02-0348.pdf, DOI 10.1554/05-087.1; Bell, G., Koufopanou, V., The cost of reproduction (1986) Oxford Surveys in Evolutionary Biology, 3, pp. 83-131; Biere, A., Genotypic and plastic variation in plant size: Effects on fecundity and allocation patterns in Lychnis flos-cuculi along a gradient of natural soil fertility (1995) Journal of Ecology, 83, pp. 629-642; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in growth, development, and body size in the yellow dung fly (1998) Evolution, 52, pp. 1394-1407; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Heyland, A., The quantitative genetics of two life history trade-offs in the yellow dung fly in abundant and limited food environments (2004) Evolutionary Ecology, 18, pp. 385-402; Bonte, D., De La Peña, E., Evolution of body conditiondependent dispersal in metapopulations (2009) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 22, pp. 1242-1251; Braendle, C., Davis, G.K., Brisson, J.A., Stern, D.L., Wing dimorphism in aphids (2006) Heredity, 97, pp. 192-199; Calow, P., Woollhead, A.S., The relationship between ration, reproductive effort and age-specific mortality in the evolution of life-history strategies: Some observations on freshwater triclads (1977) Journal of Animal Ecology, 46, pp. 765-781; Chippindale, A.K., Leroi, A.M., Kim, S.B., Rose, M.R., Phenotypic plasticity and selection in drosophila life-history evolution. 1.

In this review, I examine two aspects of adaptive radiation: first, that it results from ecological opportunity and, second, that it is deterministic in terms of its outcome and evolutionary trajectory. Ecological opportunity is usually a prerequisite for adaptive radiation, although in some cases, radiation can occur in the absence of preexisting opportunity. Nonetheless, many clades fail to radiate although seemingly in the presence of ecological opportunity; until methods are developed to identify and quantify ecological opportunity, the concept will have little predictive utility in understanding a priori when a clade might be expected to radiate. Although predicted by theory, replicated adaptive radiations occur only rarely, usually in closely related and poorly dispersing taxa found in the same region on islands or in lakes. Contingencies of a variety of types may usually preclude close similarity in the outcome of evolutionary diversification in other situations. Whether radiations usually unfold in the same general sequence is unclear because of the unreliability of methods requiring phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral events. The synthesis of ecological, phylogenetic, experimental, and genomic advances promises to make the coming years a golden age for the study of adaptive radiation; natural history data, however, will always be crucial to understanding the forces shaping adaptation and evolutionary diversification. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptive radiation; Contingency; Ecological opportunity","adaptive radiation; evolutionary theory; genome; phylogenetics; adaptation; animal; article; ecosystem; evolution; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Ecosystem; Evolution",,,,,,"Abzhanov, A., Protas, M., Grant, B.R., Grant, P.R., Tabin, C.J., Bmp4 and morphological variation of beaks in Darwin's finches (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1462-1465; Abzhanov, A., Kuo, W.P., Hartmann, C., Grant, B.R., Grant, P.R., Tabin, C.J., The calmodulin pathway and evolution of elongated beak morphology in Darwin's finches (2006) Nature, 442, pp. 563-567; Ackerly, D.D., Schwilk, D.W., Webb, C.O., Niche evolution and adaptive radiation: Testing the order of trait divergence (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. S50-S61; Agrawal, A.A., Fishbein, M., Halitschke, R., Hastings, A.P., Rabosky, D.L., Rasmann, S., Evidence for adaptive radiation from a phylogenetic study of plant defenses (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 106, pp. 18067-18072; Arbogast, B.S., Drovetski, S.V., Curry, R.L., Boag, P.T., Seutin, G., Grant, P.R., Grant, B.R., Anderson, D.J., The origin and diversification of Galapagos mockingbirds (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 370-382; Arnold, E.N., Investigating the origins of performance advantage (1994) Phylogenetics and Ecology, pp. 123-168. , P.

Here, I present a patch-structured model to explore the conditions that favor dimorphism when dispersal is coupled with sex allocation. The model shows that if the proportion of fruits dispersed from a cosexual plant increases with its allocation to fruits (causing accelerating fitness returns from dispersed fruits), disruptive selection can arise when the cost of dispersal is minimal and the correlation among patchmates (i.e., relatedness) is high. In reality, however, the proportion of fruits dispersed from a plant's patch may decline with further allocation to fruits. Even in this case, novel contexts that lead to disruptive selection on sex allocation are discovered, occurring when dispersal costs are high and relatedness is low, which causes accelerating returns from nondispersed fruits. Hence, surprisingly, gender dimorphism can evolve because female specialists are better able to escape local competition or to succeed in it. Building on the few existing models of disruptive selection on social traits, the mechanisms here show that selection for relaxed local competition (cooperation) can sometimes facilitate diversification and sometimes prevent it. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Dioecy; Evolutionary branching; Kin selection; Local resource competition; Sex allocation; Viscous population","dimorphism; dioecy; dispersal; evolutionary biology; fruit; kin selection; relatedness; resource availability; sex allocation; animal; article; biological model; evolution; fruit; genetic selection; genetics; growth, development and aging; plant; sexual development; Animals; Evolution; Fruit; Models, Genetic; Plants; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics; Animalia",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Matsuda, H., Harada, Y., Evolutionary unstable fitness maxima and stable fitness minima of continuous traits (1993) Evolutionary Ecology, 7, pp. 465-487; Ajar, E., Analysis of disruptive selection in subdivided populations (2003) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 3, p. 22. , http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/22, DOI 10.1186/1471-2148-3-22; Barot, S., Gignoux, J., How do sessile dioecious species cope with their males?

We suggest that a broad class of limiting-factors problems involving essential resources or essential components of reproductive effort can be analyzed with an evolutionary application of Liebig's law of the minimum. We explore life-history evolution using the metaphor of an organism that must harvest two essential resources (resources 1 and 2) from a stochastically varying environment. Our models make three predictions. First, organisms should overinvest, relative to the deterministic case, in harvesting the resource whose per-offspring harvest cost is smaller. Second, at the optimum, organisms balance multiple fitness-limiting factors rather than being consistently limited by one factor. Third, the optimal investment in harvesting a resource is directly linked to the probability that the organism's fitness will be limited by that resource. Under temporal variation, the optimal proportional investment in harvesting resource 1 is equal to the probability that resource 1 will limit fitness. Our results help to explain why the responses of populations to environmental perturbations are hard to predict: as an organism transitions between different limiting factors, its responses to perturbations of those factors will likewise change. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Ecological predictability; Liebig's law of the minimum; Life-history evolution; Limiting factors; Stochastic environments","evolutionarily stable strategy; evolutionary biology; fitness; life history theory; limiting factor; reproductive effort; reproductive success; resource allocation; stochasticity; temporal variation; article; biological model; ecosystem; evolution; genetic fitness; reproduction; time; Ecosystem; Evolution; Genetic Fitness; Models, Genetic; Reproduction; Time Factors",,,,,,"Aizen, M.A., Harder, L.D., Expanding the limits of the pollen-limitation concept: Effects of pollen quantity and quality (2007) Ecology, 88, pp. 271-281; Alexander, R.M., A theory of mixed chains applied to safety factors in biological systems (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 184, pp. 247-252; Ashman, T.-L., Knight, T.M., Steets, J.A., Amarasekare, P., Burd, M., Campbell, D.R., Dudash, M.R., Pollen limitation of plant reproduction: Ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 2408-2421; Axsäter, S., (2006) Inventory Control., , 2nd ed.

In this study, I present an epidemiological model for the intrinsic rate of spread (R<sub>0</sub>) for an infectious disease. The results show that the average value for R<sub>0</sub>, (R <sub>0</sub>) is inversely related to the number of host genotypes in the population (G), assuming that each host genotype is susceptible to a different parasite genotype. Specifically, for large host populations, R<sub>0</sub> is equal to B/G, where B is the number of infectious propagules produced by each infection that contact a different host. The results also suggest that virulent, single-strain infections, which initially spread in genetically diverse host populations, would quickly die out when the parasite depresses the frequency of susceptible hosts below 1/B. These results are consistent with empirical studies showing that genetically diverse host populations suffer less from pathogens and parasites. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Disease spread; Epidemics; Genetic diversity; R<sub>0</sub>","disease spread; epidemic; genetic variation; genotype; host; infectivity; parasite; pathogen; propagule; virulence; article; biological model; disease transmission; genetic variability; genotype; host pathogen interaction; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Models, Genetic",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.R., Lively, C.M., Infection genetics: Gene-for-gene versus matching-allele models, and all points in between (2002) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 4, pp. 79-90; Altermatt, F., Ebert, D., Genetic diversity of Daphnia magna populations enhances resistance to parasites (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 918-928; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Baer, B., Schmid-Hempel, P., Experimental variation in polyandry affects parasite loads and fitness in a bumble-bee (1999) Nature, 397, pp. 161-164; Carius, H.-J., Little, T.J., Ebert, D., Genetic variation in a host-parasite association: Potential for coevolution and frequencydependent selection (2001) Evolution, 55, pp. 1136-1145; Dwyer, G., Elkinton, J.S., Buonaccorsi, J.P., Host heterogeneity in susceptibility and disease dynamics: Tests of a mathematical model (1997) American Naturalist, 150 (6), pp. 685-707. , DOI 10.1086/286089; Dybdahl, M., Jokela, J., Delph, L.F., Koskella, B., Lively, C.M., Hybrid fitness in a locally adapted parasite (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. 772-782; Engelstädter, J., Bonhoeffer, S., Red Queen dynamics with non-standard fitness interactions (2009) PLoS Computational Biology, 5, pp. el000469; Frank, S.A., Specificity versus detectable polymorphism in hostparasite genetics (1993) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 254, pp. 191-197; Hawkins, B., Thomas, M., Hochberg, M.E., Refuge theory and biological control (1993) Science, 262, pp. 1429-1432; Nath, M., Woolliams, J.A., Bishop, S.C., Assessment of the dynamics of microparasite infections in genetically homogeneous and heterogeneous populations using a stochastic epidemic model (2008) Journal of Animal Science, 86, pp. 1747-1757; Otto, S.P., Day, T., (2007) A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Otto, S.P., Michalakis, Y., The evolution of recombination in changing environments (1998) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 13 (145), p. 151; Springbett, A.J., MacKenzie, K., Woolliams, J.A., Bishop, S.C., The contribution of genetic diversity to the spread of infectious diseases in livestock populations (2003) Genetics, 165 (3), pp. 1465-1474; Yates, A., Antia, R., Regoes, R.R., How do pathogen evolution and host heterogeneity interact in disease emergence?

Previous authors have suggested that wasteful pollen transfer by bats accounted for the pattern. Here we propose and test a new hypothesis: bats select for increased pollen production because they can efficiently transfer larger amounts of pollen, which leads to a more linear male fitness gain curve for bat-pollinated plants. Flight cage experiments with artificial flowers and flowers of Aphelandra acanthus provide support for this hypothesis; in both instances, the amount of pollen delivered to stigmas by birds is not related to the amount of pollen removed from anthers on the previous visit, while the same function for bats increases linearly. Thus, increased pollen production will be linearly related to increased male reproductive success for bat flowers, while for bird flowers, increased pollen production leads to rapidly diminishing fitness returns. We speculate that fur takes up and holds more pollen than feathers, which seem to readily shed excess grains. Our gain-curve hypothesis may also explain why evolutionary shifts from bird to bat pollination seem more common than shifts in the opposite direction. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Aphelandra acanthus; Burmeistera; Chiropterophily; Male fitness gain curves; Ornithophily; Sex allocation theory","bat; bird; cloud forest; dicotyledon; feather; fitness; flower; ornithophily; pollen; pollination; reproductive success; sex allocation; Acanthaceae; animal; article; bat; bird; feather; flower; hair; physiology; pollination; Acanthaceae; Animals; Birds; Chiroptera; Feathers; Flowers; Hair; Pollination; Ecuador; Acanthus; Aphelandra; Aves; Burmeistera; Trochilidae",,,,,,"Brunet, J., Sex allocation in hermaphroditic plants (1992) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 7, pp. 79-84; Buzato, S., Sazima, M., Sazima, I., Pollination of three species of abutilon (Malvaceae) intermediate between bat and hummingbird flower syndromes (1994) Flora, 189, pp. 327-334; Castellanos, M.C., Wilson, P., Thomson, J.D., "":Anti-bee"": and "":pro-bird"": changes during the evolution of hummingbird pollination in penstemon flowers (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 17, pp. 876-885; Castellanos, M.C., Wilson, P., Keller, S.J., Wolfe, A.D., Thomson, J.D., Anther evolution: Pollen presentation strategies when pollinators differ (2006) American Naturalist, 167, pp. 288-296; Charnov, E.L., (1982) The Theory of Sex Allocation, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Cruden, R.W., Miller-Ward, S., Pollen-ovule ratio, pollen size, and the ratio of stigmatic area to the pollen-bearing area of the pollinator: An hypothesis (1981) Evolution, 35, pp. 964-974; Dar, S., Arizmendi, M.D., Valiente-Banuet, A., Diurnal and nocturnal pollination of marginatocereus marginatus (Pachycereeae: Cactaceae) in central Mexico (2006) Annals of Botany, 97, pp. 423-427; De Jong, T.J., Klinkhamer, P.G.L., (2005) Evolutionary Ecology of Plant Reproductive Strategies, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Dobat, K., Peikert-Holle, T., (1985) Bluten und Fledermause, , Waldemar Kramer, Frankfurt am Main; Faegri, K., Van Der Pijl, L., (1979) The Principles of Pollination Ecology, , 3rd rev. ed.

A few theoretical studies suggest that males may exhibit - but only under rare circumstances - a reversed male mate choice (RMMC; i.e., highly competitive males focus on the most fecund females, while the low-quality males exclusively pair with less fecund mates to avoid being outcompeted by stronger rivals). Here we propose a new model to explore RMMC by relaxing some of the restrictive assumptions of the previous models and by considering an extended range of factors known to alter the strength of sexual selection (males' investment in reproduction, difference of quality between females, operational sex ratio). Unexpectedly, we found that males exhibited a reversed mate choice under a wide range of circumstances. RMMC mostly occurs when the female encounter rate is high and males devote much of their time to breeding. This condition-dependent strategy occurs even if there is no risk of injury during the male-male contest or when the difference in quality between females is small. RMMC should thus be a widespread yet underestimated component of sexual selection and should largely contribute to the assortative pairing patterns observed in numerous taxa. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Assortative pairing; Competitive ability; Dynamic game; Intrasexual competition; Male mate choice; Sexual selection","assortative mating; breeding season; fecundity; intrasexual interaction; mate choice; sex ratio; sexual selection; animal; article; biological model; competitive behavior; female; fertility; game; male; mate choice; sex ratio; Animals; Competitive Behavior; Female; Fertility; Game Theory; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Models, Biological; Sex Ratio",,,,,,"Amundsen, T., Forsgren, E., Male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 98 (23), pp. 13155-13160. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.211439298; Male preference for colourful females affected by male size in a marine fish (2003) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 54, pp. 55-64; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bel-Venner, M.C., Venner, S., Mate-guarding strategies and male competitive ability in an orb-weaving spider: Results from a field study (2006) Animal Behaviour, 71, pp. 1315-1322; Bel-Venner, M.C., Dray, S., Allaine, D., Menu, F., Venner, S., Unexpected male choosiness for mates in a spider (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 275, pp. 77-82; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Behavioral causes and consequences of sexual size dimorphism (2005) Ethology, 111 (11), pp. 977-1016. , DOI 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2005.01147.x; Bonduriansky, R., The evolution of male mate choice in insects: A synthesis of ideas and evidence (2001) Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 76 (3), pp. 305-339. , DOI 10.1017/S1464793101005693; Buston, P.M., Emlen, S.T., Cognitive processes underlying human mate choice: The relationship between self-perception and mate preference in Western society (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, pp. 8805-8810; Candolin, U., Salesto, T., Does competition allow male mate choosiness in threespine sticklebacks?

The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio). The periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events. A periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics. The model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population. To study how the vital rates influence population growth rate, population structure, and operational sex ratio, we used sensitivity analysis of frequencydependent nonlinear models. In nonlinear two-sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure. The indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis. We find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin, a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior. This result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction. Our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Emperor penguin; Mating systems; Population growth rate; Population structure; Sex ratio; Two-sex periodic matrix model","breeding season; evolutionary theory; growth rate; mating behavior; nonlinearity; population growth; population modeling; population structure; reproductive strategy; seabird; seasonality; sensitivity analysis; sex ratio; survival; animal; article; biological model; female; male; penguin; population growth; sex ratio; sexual behavior; Animals; Female; Male; Models, Biological; Population Growth; Sex Ratio; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Spheniscidae; Aptenodytes forsteri; Spheniscidae",,,,,,"Barbraud, C., Weimerskirch, H., Emperor penguins and climate change (2001) Nature, 411, pp. 183-186; Barclay, H., Sterile insect technique: Principles and practice in area-wide integrated pest management (2005) Mathematical Models for the Use of Sterile Insects, pp. 147-174. , V.

Reciprocal specialization and vertical symbiont cotransmission are thought to promote a pattern of largely synchronous revolutionary diversification in attines. Here we test this hypothesis by inferring the first time-calibrated multigene phylogeny of the lepiotaceous attine cultivars and comparing it with the recently published fossilanchored phylogeny of the attine ants. While this comparison reveals some possible cases of synchronous origins of ant and fungal clades, there were a number of surprising asynchronies. For example, leafcutter cultivars appear to be significantly younger than the corresponding ant genera. Similarly, a clade of fungi interacting with primitive fungus-gardening ants-thought to be ancestral to the more derived leaf-cutter symbionts-appears instead to be a more recent acquisition from free-living stock. These macroevolutionary patterns are consistent with recent population-level studies suggesting occasional acquisition of novel cultivar types from environmental sources and horizontal transmission of cultivars between different ant species. Horizontal transmission events, even if rare, appear to form loose ecological connections between diffusely coevolving ant and fungus lineages that permit punctuated changes in the topology of the mutualistic ant-fungus interaction network. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Acromyrmex; Atta; Attini; Coevolution; Lepiotaceae; Leucoagaricus","ant; coevolution; cultivar; host-symbiont interaction; mushroom; mutualism; phylogeny; symbiont; synchrony; Agaricales; animal; ant; article; genetics; phylogeny; symbiosis; Agaricales; Animals; Ants; Phylogeny; Symbiosis; Acromyrmex; Atta; Attini; Formicidae; Fungi; Lepiotaceae; Leucoagaricus",,,,,,"Aanen, D.K., Eggleton, P., Rouland-LeFevre, C., Guldberg-Froslev, T., Rosendahl, S., Boomsma, J.J., The evolution of fungusgrowing termites and their mutualistic fungal symbionts (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 99, pp. 14887-14892; Aanen, D.K., Ros, V.I.D., De Fine Licht, H.H., Mitchell, J., De Beer, Z.W., Slippers, B., Rouland-LeFevre, C., Boomsma, J.J., Patterns of interaction specificity of fungus-growing termites and Termitomyces symbionts in South Africa (2007) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 7, p. 115; Bascompte, J., Jordano, P., Plant-animal mutualistic networks: The architecture of biodiversity (2007) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 38, pp. 567-593; Bascompte, J., Jordano, P., Olesen, J.M., Asymmetric coevolutionary networks facilitate biodiversity maintenance (2006) Science, 312, pp. 431-433; Becerra, J.X., Synchronous coadaptation in an ancient case of herbivory (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, pp. 12804-12807; Bidartondo, M.I., The evolutionary ecology of mycoheterotrophy (2005) New Phytologist, 167, pp. 335-352; Borowicz, V.A., Juliano, S.A., Specificity in host fungus associations: Do mutualists differ from antagonists?

There is, however, little evidence for territorial defense coalitions whereby a neighbor will temporarily leave his/her own territory, enter that of a neighbor, and cooperate in repelling a conspecific intruder. This is surprising, as theoreticians have long posited the existence of such coalitions and the circumstances under which they should evolve. Here we document territorial defense coalitions in the African fiddler crab Uca annulipes, which lives in large colonies wherein each male defends a burrow and its surrounding area against neighbors and ""floaters"" (burrowless males). Fights between a resident and a floater sometimes involve another male who has left his territory to fight the floater challenging his neighbor. Using simple experiments, we provide the first evidence of the rules determining when territorial coalitions form. Our results support recent models that suggest that these coalitions arise from by-product mutualism. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Coalitions; Cooperation; Dear enemy; Fiddler crabs; Fighting; Territoriality","behavioral ecology; burrow; cooperative behavior; crab; dear enemy phenomenon; defense behavior; experimental study; fighting; mutualism; numerical model; territoriality; animal; article; body size; Brachyura; cooperation; male; territoriality; Animals; Body Size; Brachyura; Cooperative Behavior; Male; Territoriality; Africa; Decapoda (Crustacea); Ocypodidae; Uca annulipes",,,,,,"Backwell, P., Jennions, M.D., Coalition among male fiddler crabs (2004) Nature, 430, p. 417; Backwell, P.R.Y., Passmorre, N.I., Time constraints and multiple choice criteria in the sampling behaviour and mate choice of the fiddler crab, Uca annulipes (1996) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 38 (6), pp. 407-416; Booksmythe, I., Milner, R.N.C., Jennions, M.D., Backwell, P.R.Y., How do weaponless male fiddler crabs avoid aggression?

However, these predictions assume temporal resolution on the scale of a season or year, whereas individual fossil assemblages are typically time averaged to decadd or centennial timescales. We simulate the effects of time averaging by building time-averaged assemblages from local dispersal-limited, nonaveraged assemblages and compare the predicted turnover with observed patterns in mollusk and ostracod fossil records. Time averaging substantially reduces temporal turnover such that neutrd predictions converge with those of trade-off and density-dependent models, and it tends to decrease species dominance and increase the proportion of rare species. Observed, turnover rates are comparable to an appropriately scaled neutral model: patterns of high community stability can be produced or reinforced, by time averaging alone. The community attributes of local time-averaged assemblages approach those of the metacommunity. Time-averaged assemblages are thus unlikely to capture attributes arising from processes operating at small spatial scales, but they should do well at capturing the turnover and diversity of metacommunities and thus will be a valuable basis for analyzing the large-scale processes that determine metacommunity evolution. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Community turnover; Metacommunity; Species abundance distribution; Temporal scale; Time averaging","biostratigraphy; capture method; density dependence; dispersal; dominance; endangered species; fossil assemblage; metapopulation; model test; mollusc; numerical model; ostracod; paleoecology; population distribution; population modeling; resolution; spatial analysis; speciation (biology); species diversity; time series; trade-off; turnover; animal; article; biological model; comparative study; Crustacea; ecosystem; evaluation; fossil; mollusc; time; Animals; Crustacea; Ecosystem; Fossils; Models, Biological; Mollusca; Time Factors; Mollusca; Ostracoda",,,,,,"Adler, P.B., Neutrd models fail to reproduce observed speciestime and species-area relationship in Kansas grasslands (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1265-1272; Adler, P.B., Lauenroth, W.K., The power of time: Spatiotempord scaling of species diversity (2003) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 749-756; Adler, P.B., White, E.P., Lauenroth, W.K., Kaufman, D.K., Rassweiler, A., Rusak, J.A., Evidence for a general species-timearea relationship (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2032-2039; Alin, S.R., Cohen, A.S., The live, the dead, and the very dead: Taphonomic calibration of the recent record of paleoecologicd change in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa (2004) Paleobiology, 30, pp. 44-81; Aronson, R.B., Macintyre, I.G., Precht, W.F., Murdoch, T.J.T., Wapnick, C.M., The expanding scale of species turnover events on coral reefs in Belize (2002) Ecologicd Monographs, 72, pp. 233-249; Aronson, R.B., Macintyre, I.G., Wapnick, C.M., O'Neill, M.W., Phase shifts, alternative states, and the unprecedented convergence of two reef systems (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1876-1891; Aronson, R.B., Macintyre, I.G., Lewis, S.A., Hilbun, N.L., Emergent zonation and geographic convergence of coral reefs (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2586-2600; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Time resolution in fluvial vertebrate assemblages (1982) Paleobiology, 8, pp. 211-227; Bell, G., The distribution of abundance in neutral communities (2000) American Naturalist, 155, pp. 606-617; Bengtsson, J., Baillie, S.R., Lawton, J., Community variability increases with time (1997) Oikos, 78, pp. 249-256; Borda-De-Água, L., Hubbell, S.P., He, F., (2007) Scaling Biodiversity under Neutrality, pp. 347-375. , D.

However, despite widespread observations of additive population genetic variation for fitness as well as for male sexually selected traits, estimated fitness associations between fathers and offspring are often weak. Perhaps more puzzling, the strength of these associations differs drasticdly between species, leading many researchers to question, the relevance of genetic benefits for processes of sexual selection. Here, I show that a species' sex chromosome system can strongly influence the genetic architecture of male and female fitness variation and, consequently, the heritability of fitness between fathers and their offspring. Indirect genetic benefits are reduced, and sexually antagonistic costs are pronounced, in species with X chromosomes relative to species with homomorphic sex chromosomes, environmental sex determination, or Z chromosomes. Data from the sexual selection literature are consistent with predictions of the models, though additional studies will be required, to circumvent phylogenetic nonindependence between sex determination systems. This study strongly suggests that inferences about genetic benefits of female choice must be considered within a species-specific genomic context, and it has several implications for the evolution of female preferences as well as the genomic consequences of sex and sexual selection. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Antagonism; Female choice; Good genes; Sex chromosomes; Sexual; Sexual selection","antagonism; chromosome; evolutionary biology; female behavior; fitness; genetic variation; genome; good genes hypothesis; heritability; mate choice; numerical model; phylogenetics; preference behavior; sex determination; animal; article; biological model; female; genetic fitness; genetic linkage; genetic selection; male; mate choice; sex chromosome; Animals; Female; Genetic Fitness; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Models, Genetic; Selection, Genetic; Sex Chromosomes",,,,,,"Albert, A.Y.K., Otto, S.P., Sexual selection can resolve sex-linked sexual antagonism (2005) Science, 310, pp. 119-121; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Baer, C.F., Miyamoto, M.M., Denver, D., Mutation rate variation in multicellular eukaryotes: Causes and consequences (2007) Nature Reviews Genetics, 8, pp. 619-631; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Berglund, A., Bisazza, A., Pilastro, A., Armaments and ornaments: An evolutionary explanation of traits of dual utility (1996) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 58 (4), pp. 385-399. , DOI 10.1006/bijl.1996.0043; Boake, C.R.B., Genetic consequences of mate choice: A quantitative genetic method for testing sexual selection theory (1985) Science, 227, pp. 1061-1063; Bonduriansky, R., Chenoweth, S.F., Intralocus sexual conflict (2009) Trends in Ecology 8c Evolution, 24, pp. 280-288; Borgia, G., Sexual selection and the evolution of mating systems (1979) Sexual Selection and Reproductive Competition, pp. 19-80. , in M.

Here it is shown that Lévy walk movement patterns will arise from animals that randomly reorient on detection of odor trails and/or scent marks left by correlated random walkers. The emergent Levy walk movement patterns are advantageous when one is randomly searching for sparsely distributed resources. Consequently, there will be strong selection pressures for the aforementioned reorientation process when resources are sparsely distributed within unpredictable environments inhabited by correlated random walkers. This selection pressure may drive the evolution of Levy walk strategies in these landscapes. The mechanism may account for the Levy walk movement patterns of microzooplankton in the presence of mobile phytoplankton and those of a species of African jackal that scavenges within landscapes inhabited by other animal species. These findings show that Lévy walks and fractal scaling do not exist outside of the correlated random-walk paradigm, as is widely thought, but are instead natural consequences of it. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Brownian walk; Emergence; Lévy walk; Optimal foraging","canid; dominance; emergence; evolutionary biology; foraging behavior; habitat type; landscape; movement; numerical model; odor; optimum foraging theory; plankton; animal; appetite; article; association; evolution; locomotion; odor; Animals; Appetitive Behavior; Cues; Evolution; Locomotion; Odors; Animalia",,,,,,"Atkinson, R.P.D., Rhodes, C.J., Macdonald, D.W., Anderson, R.M., Scale-free dynamics in the movement patterns of jackals (2002) Oikos, 98, pp. 134-140; Bartumeus, F., Behavioral intermittence, Lévy patterns, and randomness in animal movement (2009) Oikos, 118, pp. 488-494; Bartumeus, F., Peters, F., Pueyo, S., Marrase, C., Catalan, J., Helical Lévy walks: Adjusting searching statistics to resource availability in microzooplankton (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 100 (22), pp. 12771-12775. , DOI 10.1073/pnas.2137243100; Boyer, D., Ramos-Fernandez, G., Miramontes, O., Mateos, J.L., Cocho, G., Larralde, H., Ramos, H., Rojas, F., Scale-free foraging by primates emerges from their interaction with a complex environment (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273 (1595), pp. 1743-1750. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2005.3462; Edwards, A.M., Phillips, R.A., Watkins, N.W., Freeman, M.P., Murphy, E.J., Afanasyev, V., Buldyrev, S.V., Revisiting Lévy walk search patterns of wandering albatrosses, bumblebees and deer (2007) Nature, 449, pp. 1044-1048; Focardi, S., Montanaro, P., Pecchioli, E., Adaptive Levy walks in foraging fallow dear (2009) PLoS ONE, 4, pp. e6587; Gnedenko, B.V., Kolmogorov, A.N., (1954) Limit Distributions for Sums of Independent Random Variables, , [Translated from Russian.] Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Johnson, R.P., Scent marking in mammds (1973) Animal Behavior, 21, pp. 521-535; Kats, L.B., Dill, L.M., The scent of death: Chemosensory assessment of predation risk by prey animals (1998) Ecoscience, 5 (3), pp. 361-394; Knoppien, P., Reddingius, J., Predators with two modes of searching: A mathematical model (1985) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 114, pp. 273-301; Lawler, G.F., Schramm, O., Werner, W., The dimension of the planar Brownian frontier is 4/3 (2001) Mathematical Research Letters, 8 (1-2), pp. 13-23; Lévy, P., Théorie de l'addition des variables aléatoires.

Although resource levels certainly fluctuate, K has almost always been treated as constant in both theoretical and empirical studies. We quantified temporal variation in K by fitting extensions of standard population dynamic models to 16 annual censuses of a population of the perennial bunchgrass Bouteloua rigidiseta. Variable-K models provided substantially better fits to the data than did models that varied the potential rate of population increase. The distribution of estimated values of K was skewed, with a long right tail (i.e., a few ""jackpot"" years). The population did not track K closely. Relatively slow responses to changes in K combined with large, rapid changes in K sometimes caused N to be far from K. In 13%-20% of annual intervals, K was so much larger than N that the population's dynamics were best described by geometric growth and the population was, in effect, unregulated. Explicitly incorporating temporal variation in K substantially improved the realism of models with little increase in model complexity and provided novel information about this population's dynamics. Similar methods would be applicable to many other data sets. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Bouteloua rigidiseta; Carrying capacity; Density dependence; Environmental stochasticity; Population dynamics; Population regulation","rain; carrying capacity; data set; density dependence; empirical analysis; geometry; grass; growth response; nitrogen; numerical model; perennial plant; population distribution; population modeling; population regulation; population size; potassium; stochasticity; temporal variation; article; ecosystem; Poaceae; population density; statistical model; United States; Ecosystem; Models, Statistical; Poaceae; Population Density; Rain; Texas; Bouteloua rigidiseta",,,,,,"Adams, B.M., Banks, H.T., Banks, J.E., Stark, J.D., Population dynamics models in plant-insect herbivore-pesticide interactions (2005) Mathematical Biosciences, 196 (1), pp. 39-64. , DOI 10.1016/j.mbs.2004.09.001, PII S0025556404001828; Adler, P.B., Hillerislambers, J., The influence of climate and species composition on the population dynamics often prairie forbs (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 3049-3060; Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum principle (1973) Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Information Theory, pp. 267-281. , B.

Currently we have little understanding of both the causes of this variation and its evolutionary consequences for other life-history traits. We examine how different levels of spatial structure affect the evolution of cannibalism and how cannibalism in turn drives the evolution of dispersal. Using pair approximations and simulations, we show that cannibalism can easily evolve in spatially structured populations as long as some dispersal exists. Furthermore, for a wide range of intermediate levels of spatial structure, we find the possibility of evolutionary branching leading to polymorphism in cannibalism. We also show that cannibalism itself can have important evolutionary consequences and select for increased dispersal rates, thus helping to determine the spatial structure of populations. The coevolution of cannibalism and dispersal results in the evolution of various alternative life-history strategies with different dispersal and cannibalism regimes. Which strategy evolves depends on the environmental conditions that determine initial cannibalism rates. Our results therefore suggest that differences in spatial structure could explain variation in the propensity for cannibalism and cannibalistic polyphenism. Furthermore, results emphasize that cannibalism can drive the evolution of other life-history traits and determine the spatial structure of natural populations. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Evolutionary branching;

Theoretical studies analyze the effects of such infections over evolutionary time and predict an increase in virulence due to the competitive advantage of virulent parasites. In contrast, experimental studies compare the overall virulence of mixed and single infections within one generation. Although these within-generation comparisons have limited relevance to existing theory, they demonstrate that within-host parasite interactions are not restricted to competition for resources, as envisaged by theory. Instead, mixed infections may result in phenotypic changes in growth rate or impaired immune clearance. Developing and using a two-parasite epidemiological model with recovery, we confirm that within-host competition for resources selects for higher virulence. However, parasite phenotypic plasticity and impaired host immunity can select for lower virulence. Because these latter two mechanisms would be detected by experimentalists as an increase in pathology, our results warn against the temptation to draw inferences on virulence evolution on the basis of single-generation experiments. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Competition for host resources; Evolution of virulence; Host immunity; Mixed infections; Parasite phenotypic plasticity","adaptive radiation; competitive ability; epidemiology; evolutionary theory; generation time; genotype; growth rate; host-parasite interaction; immunity; infectious disease; parasitic disease; pathology; phenotypic plasticity; theoretical study; virulence; article; biological model; evolution; genetic selection; host parasite interaction; immunology; organismal interaction; phenotype; virulence; Evolution; Host-Parasite Interactions; Microbial Interactions; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic; Virulence",,,,,,"Alizon, S., Decreased overall virulence in coinfected hosts leads to the persistence of virulent parasites (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. E67-E79; Alizon, S., Van Baalen, M., Emergence of a convex tradeoff between transmission and virulence (2005) American Naturalist, 165, pp. E155-E167; Multiple infections, immune dynamics, and the evolution of virulence (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. E150-E168; Anderson, R.M., May, R.M., (1991) Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bell, A.S., De Roode, J.C., Sim, D., Read, A.F., Within-host competition in genetically diverse malaria infections: Parasite virulence and competitive success (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 1358-1371; Ben-Ami, F., Mouton, L., Ebert, D., The effects of multiple infections on the expression and evolution of virulence in a Daphnia-endoparasite system (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 1700-1711; Bremermann, H.J., Pickering, J., A game-theoretical model of parasite virulence (1983) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 100, pp. 411-426; Brown, S., Hochberg, M., Grenfell, B., Does multiple infection select for raised virulence?

In order to reduce damage from herbivory, plants evolve antiherbivore defenses, the mechanisms of which have been, studied from a theoretical viewpoint. In the theoretical studies, the models of defense schedules have assumed a uniform intensity of herbivory or a constant rate of encounter of herbivores throughout the season. However, some herbivores apparently appear for only a limited period instead of the whole growing season of the plant. In our study, we analyzed the optimal schedule of defense allocation of the plant under the herbivory that occurs within a limited period with a certain probability. We assumed, an annual, plant that consists of vegetative and defensive parts and whose growing season is divided into two phases at the time of herbivore emergence. In the phase after the emergence time, the status of a plant can be either with, or without herbivore stochastically. The plant is considered to maximize the average vegetative size at the end of the growing season. We found that under the fixed emergence time, inducible defense is favored when the plant growth rate and herbivory intensity are high. Extending this result, we also analyzed the coevolution of plant defense and herbivore emergence time by using invasibility analysis. In the system considered, an equilibrium steady state tends to be absent in herbivore strategy. This suggests polymorphism of herbivore emergence time. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Evolution; Optimal phenology; Plant defense; Pontryagin's maximum principle","annual plant; antiherbivore defense; coevolution; emergence; environmental impact; evolutionary theory; growing season; invasibility; numerical model; phenology; polymorphism; seasonal variation; steady-state equilibrium; stochasticity; animal; article; biological model; evolution; food chain; plant; predation; season; Animals; Evolution; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Plants; Predatory Behavior; Seasons",,,,,,"Adler, F.R., Karban, R., Defended fortresses or moving targets? another model of inducible defenses inspired by military metaphors (1994) American Naturalist, 144, pp. 813-832; Agrawal, A.A., Induced responses to herbivory in wild radish: Effects on several herbivores and plant fitness (1999) Ecology, 80, p. 17131723; Benefits and costs of induced plant defense for Lepidlum virginicum (Brassicaceae) (2000) Ecology, 81, pp. 1804-1813; Agren, J., Schemske, D.W., The cost of defense against herbivores: An experimental study of trichome production in Brassica rapa (1993) American Naturalist, 141 (2), pp. 338-350. , DOI 10.1086/285477; Astrom, M., Lundberg, P., Plant defence and stochastic risk of herbivory (1994) Evolutionary Ecology, 8 (3), pp. 288-298; Boege, K., Marquis, R.J., Facing herbivory as you grow up: The ontogeny of resistance in plants (2005) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 20 (8), pp. 441-448. , DOI 10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.001, PII S0169534705001485; Broom, M., Speed, M.P., Ruxton, G.D., Evolutionarily stable investment in secondary defences (2005) Functional Ecology, 19 (5), pp. 836-843. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.01030.x; Clark, C.W., Harvell, C.D., Inducible defenses and the allocation of resources: A minimal model (1992) American Naturalist, 139, pp. 521-539; Cohen, D., Maximizing final yield when growth is limited by time or by limiting resources (1971) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 33, pp. 299-307; Coley, P.D., Bryant, J.P., Chapin III, F.S., Resource availability and plant antiherbivore defense (1985) Science, 230, pp. 895-899; Duffey, S.S., Stout, M.J., Antinutritive and toxic components of plant defense against insects (1996) Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, 32, pp. 3-37; Feeny, P., Biochemical coevolution between plants and their insect herbivores (1975) Coevolution of Animals and Plants, , Pages 1-19 in L.

Here, I test the condition dependence and heritability of the facial patterns that function as a conventional signal of quality in Polistes dominulus wasps. Two aspects of facial patterns are compared: (1) amount of black pigment (no signal value) and (2) disruption in the black pigment's distribution (quality signal). When colonies received the same diet, they produced offspring with similar facial patterns and both traits were heritable. However, experimental diet manipulation substantially influenced quality signal development. Wasps fed unlimited caterpillars developed more disrupted facial patterns than wasps fed a restricted diet. Further, signal heritability was obscured following the diet treatment. In contrast, the nonsignaling trait was not influenced by the diet treatment and remained heritable. Overall, the quality signal in P. dominulus is condition dependent and heritable, but its heritability may be obscured by environmental variance. The nonsignaling aspect of wasp facial patterns is not condition dependent and is more consistently heritable across environments. Therefore, the information a signal conveys may be influenced by its developmental properties rather than its honesty-ensuring cost or the pigments that constitute it. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Badge of status; Honesty; Melanin; Ornament; Sexual selection; Social selection","body condition; caterpillar; color morph; developmental biology; diet; environmental conditions; heritability; honest signaling; life history trait; melanin; sexual selection; signaling; wasp; animal; animal communication; article; comparative study; diet; environment; female; metabolism; physiology; pigmentation; protein intake; quantitative trait; wasp; Animal Communication; Animals; Diet; Dietary Proteins; Environment; Female; Pigmentation; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Wasps; Polistes dominulus; Polistinae",,"Dietary Proteins",,,,"Alatalo, R.V., Mappes, J., Elgar, M.A., Heritabilities and paradigm shifts (1997) Nature, 385, pp. 402-403; Andersson, M., Sexual selection (1994) Monographs in Behavior and Ecology, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Becker, E., Über das Pteridinpigment bei Insekten und die Färbung und Zeichnung von Vespa im besonderen (1937) Zeitschrift für Morphologie und Ökologie der Tiere, 32, pp. 672-751; Buchanan, K.L., Evans, M.R., Goldsmith, A.R., Bryant, D.M., Rowe, L.V., Testosterone influences basal metabolic rate in male house sparrows: A new cost of dominance signalling?

Chrysina gloriosa LeConte 1854, a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern United States and northern Mexico, are camouflaged in juniper foliage; however, when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters, the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast. Given the polarization-specific changes in the appearance of C. gloriosa, we hypothesized that C. gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light. We tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of C. gloriosa toward different light stimuli. Chrysina gloriosa exhibited (a) positive phototaxis, (V) differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities, and (c) discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter-wave plate. These results demonstrate that C. gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light. In contrast, Chrysina woodi Horn 1885, a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection, exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized sensitivity may allow C. gloriosa to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators, reducing indirect costs of communication. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Circularly polarized light; Phototaxis; Polarization sensitivity; Scarab beetles","beetle; circulation modeling; flight behavior; foliage; functional morphology; hypothesis testing; light effect; mimicry; montane forest; phototaxis; polarization; sensitivity analysis; shrub; animal; animal behavior; article; beetle; female; light; male; Animals; Beetles; Behavior, Animal; Female; Light; Male; Mexico [North America]; United States; Coleoptera; Gloriosa; Juniperus; Scarabaeidae",,,,,,"Baylor, E.R., Smith, F.E., The orientation of Cladocera to polarized light (1953) American Naturalist, 87, pp. 97-101; Caveney, S., Cuticle reflectivity and optical activity in scarab beetles: The role of uric acid (1971) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 178, pp. 205-225; Chapman, R.F., (1998) The Insects: Structure and Function, , 4th ed.

We take the case of delayed predatorinduced dispersal (PID) in aphids to explore in which way current environmental conditions may be utilized as an appropriate signal for dispersd decisions. In aphids, the presence of predators triggers the production of winged offspring that may later leave the plant and shift their center of activity permanently. Using individual-based simulations as well as andytical approximations, we explore under which conditions PID is likely to evolve. We demonstrate that this requires substantial temporal correlation in prédation risk and weak competition among prey; these conditions may be fulfilled in the aphid system. We discuss the analogy between the specific case of PID and the evolution of conditional emigration in the face of spatiotemporally correlated deterioration in reproduction or survival. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Aphids; Conditional dispersal; Dispersal evolution; Predator-induced dispersd; Temporal correlation","adaptive radiation; aphid; dispersal; emigration; environmental conditions; evolutionary biology; numerical model; population density; predation risk; predator-prey interaction; reproduction; signal; survival; temporal analysis; animal; aphid; article; biological model; competitive behavior; computer simulation; decision making; ecosystem; evolution; population dynamics; predation; Animals; Aphids; Choice Behavior; Competitive Behavior; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Evolution; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Aphididae",,,,,,"Affenzeller, M., Wagner, S., Winkler, S., Beham, A., (2009) Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming: Modern Concepts and Practical Applications, , CRC, Boca Raton, FL; Albrectsen, B., Nachman, G., Female-biased density-dependent dispersal of a tephritid fly in a fragmented habitat and its implications for population regulation (2001) Oikos, 94 (2), pp. 263-272; Amarasekare, P., Interactions between local dynamics and dispersal: Insights from single species models (1998) Theoretical Population Biology, 53 (1), pp. 44-59. , DOI 10.1006/tpbi.1997.1340; The role of density-dependent dispersal, in. source-sink dynamics (2004) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 226, pp. 159-168; Back, T., (1996) Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolution Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms, , Oxford University Press, New York; Baglione, V., Canestrari, D., Marcos, J.M., Ekman, J., Experimentally increased food resources in the natal territory promote offspring philopatry and helping in cooperatively breeding carrion crows (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273 (1593), pp. 1529-1535. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2006.3481; Beketov, M.A., Liess, M., Prédation risk perception and food scarcity induce alterations of life-cycle traits of the mosquito Culex pipens (2007) Ecological Entomology, 32, pp. 405-410; Bernstein, C., Prey and predator emigration responses in the acariñe system Tetranychus-urticae-Phytoseiulus-persimilis (1984) Oecologia (Berlin), 61, pp. 134-142; Bowler, D.E., Benton, T.G., Causes and consequences of animal dispersal strategies: Relating individual behaviour to spatid dynamics (2005) Biologicd Reviews, 80, pp. 205-225; Bull, J.J., Thompson, C., Ng, D., Moore, R., A model, for natural selection of genetic migration (1987) American Naturalist, 129, pp. 143-157; Clobert, J., Le Galliard, J.F., Cote, J., Meylan, S., Massot, M., Informed dispersd, heterogeneity in animd dispersal syndromes and the dynamics of spatially structured populations (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 197-209; Crespi, B.J., Taylor, P.D., Dispersal rates under variable patch density (1990) American Naturalist, 135, pp. 48-62; Diss, A.L., Kunkel, J.G., Montgomery, M.E., Leonard, D.E., Effects of maternal nutrition and egg provisioning on parameters of larval hatch, survival and dispersal in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L (1996) Oecologia, 106 (4), pp. 470-477; Dixon, A.F.G., (2000) Insect Predator-prey Dynamics: Ladybird Beetles and Biologicd Control, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Doebeli, M., Ruxton, G.D., Evolution of dispersal rates in metapopulation models: Branching and cyclic dynamics in phenotype space (1997) Evolution, 51 (6), pp. 1730-1741; Duckworth, R.A., Maternal effects and range expansion: A key factor in a dynamic process?

Current life-history theory does not offer a consistent view on the origin of this diversity. We use dynamic optimization to examine resource allocation in seasonal, environments, considering that offspring produced at different times of the season have unequal future prospects. Reduction of these prospects during the season produced indeterminate growers that grew mostly after maturation, achieving large final body sizes. It also changed the optimal timing of growth and reproduction during a season, from grow-first-reproduce- later, as usually predicted by lifehistory theory, to the reproduce-first-grow- later tactic; other tactics were produced by the interactive effects of winter survival and unequal offspring prospects. The results suggest that devaluation of offspring production provides conditions for the evolution of capital breeding, even in fully predictable seasonal environments. Thus, the unequal fate of newborns from different parts of a season may explain the origin of diversity of reproductive phenologies, growth patterns, and capital breeding in nature. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Capital breeding; Income breeding; Life history; Optimal allocation models; Reproductive phenology","body size; captive breeding; growth rate; life history trait; maturation; optimization; origin of life; phenology; reproduction; resource allocation; seasonal variation; species diversity; survival; vegetation type; animal; article; biological model; evolution; growth; reproduction; season; Animals; Evolution; Growth; Models, Biological; Reproduction; Seasons; Amphibia; Mollusca; Reptilia",,,,,,"Angilletta Jr., M.J., Niewiarowski, P.H., Dunham, A.E., Leaché, A.D., Porter, W.P., Bergmann's dines in ectotherms: Illustrating a life-history perspective with sceloporine lizards (2004) American Naturalist, 164, pp. E168-E183; Angilletta Jr., M.J., Steury, T.D., Sears, M.W., Temperature, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: Fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle (2004) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 44, pp. 498-509; Ballinger, R.E., Congdon, J.D., Population ecology and life history strategy of a montane lizard (Sceloporus scalaris) in southwest Arizona (1981) Journal of Natural History, 5, pp. 213-222; Begg, G.A., Marteinsdottir, G., Spawning origins of pelagic juvenile cod Gadus morhua inferred from spatially explicit age distributions: Potential influences on year-class strength and recruitment (2000) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 202, pp. 193-217; Bellman, R., (1957) Dynamic Programming, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Bonnet, X., Bradshaw, D., Shine, R., Capital versus income breeding: An ectothermic perspective (1998) Oikos, 83 (2), pp. 333-342; Boyd, I.L., Time and energy constraints in pinniped lactation (1998) American Naturalist, 152 (5), pp. 717-728. , DOI 10.1086/286202; Briffa, K.R., Shishov, V.V., Melvin, T.M., Vaganov, E.A., Grudd, H., Hantemirov, R.M., Eronen, M., Naurzbaev, M.M., Trends in recent temperature and radial tree growth spanning 2000 years across northwest Eurasia (2008) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological.

More recently, such approaches have been used as a means to evaluate support for the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Here we examine the utility of these approaches, using mathematical and computational models to predict the correlation that evolves between traits of interacting species for a broad, range of interaction types. Our results reveal that coevolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the evolution of spatially correlated traits between two species. Specifically, our results show that coevolutionary selection fails to consistently generate statistically significant correlations and, conversely, that non-coevolutionary processes can readily cause statistically significant correlations to evolve. In addition, our results demonstrate that studies of trait correlations per se cannot be used as evidence either for or against a geographic mosaic process. Taken together, our results suggest that understanding the coevolutionary process in natural populations will require detailed mechanistic studies conducted in multiple populations or the use of more sophisticated statistical approaches that, better use information contained in existing data sets. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Character displacement; Geographic mosaic; Local adaptation; Species interactions; Trait matching","character displacement; coevolution; correlation; data set; interspecific interaction; local adaptation; numerical model; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; evolution; genetic selection; quantitative trait; Animals; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Selection, Genetic",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The evolution of predator-prey interactions: Theory and evidence (2000) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 31, pp. 79-105; Albert, A.Y.K., Millar, N.P., Schluter, D., Character displacement of male nuptial colour in threespine sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus) (2007) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 91, pp. 37-48; Anderson, B., Johnson, S.D., The geographical mosaic of coevolution in a plant-pollinator mutualism (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 220-225; Benkman, C.W., The selection mosaic and diversifying coevolution between crossbills and lodgepole pine (1999) American Naturalist, 153 (5 SUPPL. 1), pp. S75-S91; Benkman, C.W., Parchman, T.L., Favis, A., Siepielski, A.M., Reciprocal selection causes a coevolutionary arms race between crossbills and lodgepole pine (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 182-194; Berenbaum, M.R., Zangerl, A.R., Chemical phenotype matching between a plant and its insect herbivore (1998) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 95, pp. 13743-13748; Bergelson, J., Dwyer, G., Emerson, J.J., Models and data on plant-enemy coevolution (2001) Annual Review of Genetics, 35, pp. 469-499; Brodie III, E.D., Brodie Jr., E.D., Costs of exploiting poisonous prey: Evolutionary trade-offs in a predator-prey arms race (1999) Evolution, 53, pp. 626-631; Brodie III, E.D., Ridenhour, B.J., Reciprocal selection at the phenotypic interface of coevolution (2003) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 43, pp. 408-1118; Brodie Jr., E.D., Ridenhour, B.J., Brodie III, E.D., The evolutionary response of predators to dangerous prey: Hotspots and coldspots in the geographic mosaic of coevolution between garter snakes and newts (2002) Evolution, 56, pp. 2067-2082; Carlson, R.L., Wainwright, P.C., Near, T.J., Relationship between species co-occurrence and rate of morphological change in Percina darters (Percidae.

Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, Netherlands","Entropy maximization (EM, also known as MaxEnt) is a general inference procedure that originated in statistical mechanics. It has been applied recently to predict ecological patterns, such as species abundance distributions and species-area relationships. It is well known in physics that the EM result strongly depends on how elementary configurations are described. Here we argue that the same issue is also of crucial importance for EM applications in ecology. To illustrate this, we focus on the EM prediction of species-level spatial abundance distributions. We show that the EM outcome depends on (1) the choice of configuration set, (2) the way constraints are imposed, and (3) the scale on which the EM procedure is applied. By varying these choices in the EM model, we obtain a large range of EM predictions. Interestingly, they correspond to spatial abundance distributions that have been derived previously from mechanistic models.We argue that the appropriate choice of the EMmodel assumptions is nontrivial and can be determined only by comparison with empirical data. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Broken stick model; HEAP model; Prior distribution; Random-placement model; Scale transformation; Spatial abundance distribution","abundance; ecological modeling; entropy; spatial distribution; species-area relationship; article; biological model; ecosystem; entropy; geography; population density; Ecosystem; Entropy; Geography; Models, Biological; Population Density",,,,,,"Banavar, J.R., Maritan., A., (2007) The Maximum Relative Entropy Principle, , http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703622, Preprint; Chave, J., Alonso, D., Etienne., R.S., Comparing models of species abundance (2006) Nature, 414, pp. E1-E2; Coleman, B.R., On random placement and species-area relations (1981) Mathematical Biosciences, 54, pp. 191-215; Conlisk, E., Bloxham, M., Conlisk, J., Enquist, B., Harte., J., A new class of models of spatial distribution (2007) Ecological Monographs, 77, pp. 269-284; Dewar, R.C., Porté., A., Statistical mechanics unifies different ecological patterns (2008) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 251, pp. 389-403; Etienne, R.S., A new sampling formula for neutral biodiversity (2005) Ecology Letters, 8, pp. 253-260; A neutral sampling formula for multiple samples and an ""exact"" test of neutrality (2007) Ecology Letters, 10, pp. 608-618; Etienne, R.S., Olff., H., Confronting different models of community structure to species-abundance data: A Bayesian model comparison (2005) Ecology Letters, 8, pp. 493-504; Haegeman, B., Loreau., M., Limitations of entropy maximization in ecology (2008) Oikos, 117, pp. 1700-1710; Trivial and non-trivial applications of entropy maximization in ecology: A reply to Shipley (2009) Oikos, 118, pp. 1270-1278; Harte, J., Conlisk, E., Ostling, A., Green, J., Smith., A., A theory of spatial structure in ecological communities at multiple spatial scales (2005) Ecological Monographs, 75, pp. 179-197; Harte, J., Zillio, T., Conlisk, E., Smith., A.B., Maximum entropy and the state variable approach to macroecology (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 2700-2711; Jaynes, E.T., Information theory and statistical mechanics (1957) Physical Review, 106, pp. 620-630; (2003) Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan., N., (1997) Discrete Mul-tivariate Distributions, , Wiley, New York; MacArthur, R., On the relative abundance of species (1960) American Naturalist, 94, pp. 25-36; Maddux, R.D., Self-similarity and the species-area relationship (2004) American Naturalist, 163, pp. 616-626; Ostling, A., Harte, J., Green, J.L., Kinzig., A.P., Self-similarity, the power law form of the species-area relationship, and a probability rule: A reply to Maddux (2004) American Naturalist, 163, pp. 627-633; Pueyo, S., He, F., Zillio., T., The maximum entropy formalism and the idiosyncratic theory of biodiversity (2007) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 1017-1028; Shipley, B., Vile, D., Garnier., E., From plant traits to plant communities: A statistical mechanistic approach to biodiversity (2006) Science, 314, pp. 812-814; Volkov, I., Banavar, J.R., Hubbell, S.P., Maritan., A., Neutral theory and relative species abundance in ecology (2003) Nature, 424, pp. 1035-1037","Etienne, R.

In this study, we measured the strength and form of sexual selection acting on a suite of male morphological traits in a wild ambush bug (Phymata americana) population at 10 sampling dates over 2 years.We tested the prediction that the strength and direction of sexual selection would be associated with one or more important ecological variables.We found that patterns of multivariate selection varied considerably over time, and even within a season. Yet, for this population, a sexually dimorphic color pattern trait was consistently a target of directional selection. The strength of sexual selection on this trait was related to both sex ratio and density, which is consistent with the idea that ecological factors can play an important role in generating patterns of sexual selection. We also demonstrate that the median strength of linear selection obtained from replicated cross-sectional methods was qualitatively similar to the estimates obtained from longitudinal methods, providing multiple lines of evidence that the evolution of sexual color dimorphism in this species is attributable to sexual selection. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Fluctuating selection; Phenotypic selection; Sex ratio; Sexual dimorphism; Sexual selection","insect; morphology; phenotype; population distribution; sex ratio; sexual dimorphism; sexual selection; animal; article; cross-sectional study; genetic selection; genetics; Heteroptera; longitudinal study; male; pigmentation; population density; season; sex ratio; sexual development; temperature; time; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Heteroptera; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Pigmentation; Population Density; Seasons; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics; Sex Ratio; Temperature; Time Factors; Hexapoda; Phymata americana; Phymatidae",,,,,,"Arnold, S.J., Wade., M.J., On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Applications (1984) Evolution, 38, pp. 720-734; On the measurement of natural and sexual selection: Theory (1984) Evolution, 38, pp. 709-719; Arnold, S.J., Pfrender, M.E., Jones., A.G., The adaptive landscape as a conceptual bridge between micro-and macroevo-lution (2001) Genetica, 112-113, pp. 9-32; Arnqvist, G., Spatial variation in selective regimes: Sexual selection in the water strider, Gerris odontogaster (1992) Evolution, 46, pp. 914-929; Balduf, W.V., Life history of Phymata pennsylvanica americana Melin (Phymatidae, Hemiptera) (1941) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 34, pp. 204-214; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Reuter, M., Ward, P.I., Barbour., A.D., Correction for sampling bias in quantitative measures of selection when fitness is discrete (1999) Evolution, 53, pp. 286-291; Blanckenhorn, W.U., Morf, C., Muhlhauser, C., Reusch., T., Spatiotemporal variation in selection on body size in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea (1999) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 12, pp. 563-576; Blows, M.W., A tale of two matrices: Multivariate approaches in evolutionary biology (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20, pp. 1-8; Blows, M.W., Brooks., R., Measuring nonlinear selection (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 815-820; Brodie Iii, E.B., Correlational selection for color pattern and antipredator behavior in the garter snake Thamnophis ordinoides (1992) Evolution, 46, pp. 1284-1298; Brodie III, E.B., Janzen, F.J., On the assignment of fitness values in statistical analyses of selection (1996) Evolution, 50, pp. 437-442; Brodie III, E.B., Moore, A.J., Janzen, F.J., Visualizing and quantifying natural selection (1995) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 10, pp. 313-318; Bulmer, M.G., (1980) The Mathematical Theory of Quantitative Genetics, , Clarendon, Oxford; Carroll, S.P., Salamon., M.H., Variation in sexual selection on male body size within and between populations of the soapberry bug (1995) Animal Behaviour, 50, pp. 1463-1474; Caruso, C.M., Peterson, S.B., Ridley., C.E., Natural selection on floral traits of Lobelia (Lobeliaceae): Spatial and temporal variation (2003) American Journal of Botany, 90, pp. 1333-1340; Chaine, A.S., Lyon., B.E., Adaptive plasticity in female mate choice dampens sexual selection on male ornaments in the lark bunting (2008) Science, 25, pp. 459-462; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Introduction (1988) Reproductive Success, pp. 1-6. , T.

Hypotheses based on allocation theory and herbivore selection patterns predict that defense should increase or decrease, respectively, across ontogeny, and previous research partly supports both predictions. Thus, it remains unclear which pattern is more common and what factors contribute to variability among studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 116 published studies reporting ontogenetic patterns in plant defense traits and herbivory. Patterns varied depending on plant life form (woody, herbaceous, grass), type of herbivore (insect, mollusk, mammal), and type of defense trait (secondary chemistry, physical defense, tolerance). In woody plants, chemical defense increased during the seedling stage, followed by an increase in physical defenses during the vegetative juvenile stage. Mammalian herbivores showed a strong preference for mature compared to juvenile tissues in woody plants. Herbs experienced a significant increase in secondary chemistry across the entire ontogenetic trajectory, although the magnitude of increase was greatest during the seedling stage. Correspondingly, mollusks preferred young compared to older herbs. Future research investigating growth/defense trade-offs, allometry, herbivore selection patterns, and ecological costs would shed light on the mechanisms driving the ontogenetic patterns observed. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Growth-differentiation-balance hypothesis; Induced defense; Plant resistance; Plant-age hypothesis; Seedlings; Tolerance","antiherbivore defense; herbivore; juvenile; meta-analysis; ontogeny; seedling; trade-off; animal; article; bird; feeding behavior; food chain; growth, development and aging; insect; mammal; meta analysis; metabolism; mollusc; psychological aspect; seedling; Animals; Birds; Feeding Behavior; Food Chain; Insects; Mammals; Mollusca; Seedling; Hexapoda; Mammalia; Mollusca",,,,,,"Adams, D.C., Gurevitch, J., Rosenberg., M.S., Resampling tests for meta-analysis of ecological data (1997) Ecology, 78, pp. 1277-1283; Agrawal, A.A., Fishbein., M., Plant defense syndromes (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. S132-S149; Barton, K.E., Early ontogenetic patterns in chemical defense in Plantago (Plantaginaceae): Genetic variation and trade-offs (2007) American Journal of Botany, 94, pp. 56-66; Berendse, F., Elberse., W.T., Competition and nutrient availability in heathland and grassland ecosystem.

Understanding the hydraulic functions of given venation traits can clarify the organization of the vascular system and its adaptation to environment. Using a spatially explicit model (the program K-leaf), we subjected realistic simulated leaves to modifi-cations and calculated the impacts on xylem and leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>x</sub> and Kleaf, respectively), important traits in determining photosynthesis and growth.We tested the sensitivity of leaves to altered vein order conductivities (1) in the absence or (2) presence of hierarchical vein architecture, (3) to major vein tapering, and (4) to modification of vein densities (length/leaf area). The K<sub>x</sub> and Kleaf increased with individual vein order conductivities and densities; for hierarchical venation systems, the greatest impact was from increases in vein conductivity for lower vein orders and increases in density for higher vein orders. Individual vein order conductivities were colimiting of K<sub>x</sub> and Kleaf, as were their densities, but the effects of vein conductivities and densities were orthogonal. Both vein hierarchy and vein tapering increased K<sub>x</sub> relative to xylem construction cost. These results highlight the important consequences of venation traits for the economics, ecology, and evolution of plant transport capacity. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Biological networks; Hydraulics; Leaf size; Sectoriality; Vein pattern; Xylem","growth rate; hydraulic conductivity; leaf area; photosynthesis; xylem; article; biological model; evolution; physiology; plant leaf; xylem; Evolution; Models, Biological; Plant Leaves; Xylem",,,,,,"Bohn, S., Andreotti, B., Douady, S., Munzinger, J., Couder., Y., Constitutive property of the local organization of leaf venation networks (2002) Physical Review e, 65, p. 061914; Boyce, C.K., Brodribb, T.J., Feild, T.S., Zwieniecki., M.A., Angiosperm leaf vein evolution was physiologically and environmentally transformative (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, pp. 1771-1776; Brodribb, T.J., Holbrook., N.M., Water stress deforms tracheids peripheral to the leaf vein of a tropical conifer (2005) Plant Physiology, 137, pp. 1139-1146; Brodribb, T.J., Feild, T.S., Jordan., G.J., Leaf maximum photosynthetic rate and venation are linked by hydraulics (2007) Plant Physiology, 144, pp. 1890-1898; Canny, M.J., What becomes of the transpiration stream?

We therefore explored a dynamical model of negatively buoyant algae inhabiting a one-dimensional water column to ask how water column depth and turbulence constrain total (areal) phytoplankton biomass. We show that the population persistence boundaries in water column depth-turbulence space are set by sinking losses and light limitation but that nutrients are most limiting to total biomass in water columns that are neither too shallow or too weakly mixed (where sinking losses prevail) nor too deep and turbulent (where light limitation prevails). In shallow waters, the most strongly limiting process is nutrient influx to the bottom of the water column (e.g., from sediments). In deep waters, the most strongly limiting process is turbulent upward transport of nutrients to the photic zone. Consequently, the highest total biomasses are attained in turbulent waters at intermediate water column depths and in deep waters at intermediate turbulences. These patterns are insensitive to the assumption of fixed versus flexible algal carbonto-nutrient stoichiometry, and they arise irrespective of whether the water column is a surface layer above a deep water compartment or has direct contact with sediments. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Carbon-to-phosphorus ratio; Light; Mixing intensity; Nutrients; Spatial heterogeneity; Water column depth","water; biomass; deep water; habitat selection; nutrient availability; persistence; photic zone; phytoplankton; stoichiometry; water column; alga; article; biological model; biomass; chemistry; growth, development and aging; light; microbiology; phytoplankton; water flow; Algae; Biomass; Light; Models, Biological; Phytoplankton; Water; Water Microbiology; Water Movements; algae",,"water, 7732-18-5; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Andersen, T., (1997) Pelagic Nutrient Cycles: Herbivores As Sources and Sinks, , Springer, New York; Andersen, T., Elser, J.J., Hessen., D.O., Stoichiometry and population dynamics (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 884-900; Antia, A.N., Solubilization of particles in sediment traps: Revising the stoichiometry of mixed layer export (2005) Biogeosciences, 2, pp. 189-204; Behrenfeld, M.J., O'Malley, R.T., Siegel, D.A., McClain, C.R., Sarmiento, J.L., Feldman, G.C., Milligan, A.J., Boss., E.S., Climate-driven trends in contemporary ocean productivity (2006) Nature, 444, pp. 752-755; Berger, S.A., Diehl, S., Kunz, T.J., Albrecht, D., Oucible, A.M., Ritzer., S., Light supply, plankton biomass, and seston stoi-chiometry in a gradient of lake mixing depths (2006) Limnology and Oceanography, 51, pp. 1898-1905; Berger, S.A., Diehl, S., Stibor, H., Trommer, G., Ruhenstroth, M., Wild, A., Weigert, A., Striebel., M., Water temperature and mixing depth affect timing and magnitude of events during spring succession of the plankton (2007) Oecologia (Berlin), 150, pp. 643-654; Bertilsson, S., Berglund, O., Karl, D.M., Chisholm., S.W., Elemental composition of marine Prochlorococcus and Synecho-coccus: Implications for the ecological stoichiometry of the sea (2003) Limnology and Oceanography, 48, pp. 1721-1731; Christian, J.R., Biogeochemical cycling in the oligotrophic ocean: Redfield and non-Redfield models (2005) Limnology and Oceanography, 50, pp. 646-657; Cloern, J.E., Habitat connectivity and ecosystem productivity: Implications from a simple model (2007) American Naturalist, 169, pp. E21-E33; Coats, R., Perez-Losada, J., Schladow, G., Richards, R., Goldman., C., The warming of Lake Tahoe (2006) Climatic Change, 76, pp. 121-148; Condie, S.A., Bormans., M., The influence of density stratification on particle settling, dispersion and population growth (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 187, pp. 65-75; Diehl, S., Phytoplankton, light, and nutrients in a gradient of mixing depths: Theory (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 386-398; Paradoxes of enrichment: Effects of increased light versus nutrient supply on pelagic producer-grazer systems (2007) American Naturalist, 169, pp. E173-E191; Diehl, S., Berger, S., Ptacnik, R., Wild., A., Phytoplankton, light, and nutrients in a gradient of mixing depths: Field experiments (2002) Ecology, 83, pp. 399-411; Diehl, S., Berger, S., Wöhrl., R., Flexible nutrient stoichi-ometry mediates environmental influences, on phytoplankton and its resources (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 2931-2945; Elser, J.J., George., N.B., The stoichiometry of N and P in the pelagic zone of Castle Lake, California (1993) Journal of Plankton Research, 15, pp. 977-992; Falkowski, P.G., Oliver., M.J., Mix and match: How climate selects phytoplankton (2007) Nature Reviews Microbiology, 5, pp. 813-819; Geider, R.J., MacIntyre, H.L., Kana., T.M., A dynamic regulatory model of phytoplanktonic acclimation to light, nutrients, and temperature (1998) Limnology and Oceanography, 43, pp. 679-694; George, D.C., Hewitt., D.P., The impact of year-to-year changes in the weather on the dynamics of Daphnia in a thermally stratified lake (2006) Aquatic Ecology, 40, pp. 33-47; Huisman, J., Population dynamics of light-limited phytoplank-ton: Microcosm experiments (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 202-210; Huisman, J., Sommeijer., B., Maximal sustainable sinking velocity of phytoplankton (2002) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 244, pp. 39-48; Huisman, J., Weissing., F.J., Competition for nutrients and light in a mixed water column: A theoretical analysis (1995) American Naturalist, 146, pp. 536-564; Huisman, J., Van Oostveen, P., Weissing., F.J., Critical depth and critical turbulence: Two different mechanisms for the development of phytoplankton blooms (1999) Limnology and Oceanography, 44, pp. 1781-1787; Huisman, J., Arrayas, M., Ebert, U., Sommeijer., B., How do sinking phytoplankton species manage to persist?

Survival is sensibly modeled as a binomial process, but annual reproductive success (ARS) is more complex and general models for demographic stochasticity do not exist. Here we introduce a stochastic model framework for ARS and illustrate some of its properties. We model a sequence of stochastic events: nest completion, the number of eggs or neonates produced, nest predation, and the survival of individual offspring to independence. We also allow multiple nesting attempts within a breeding season. Most of these components can be described by Bernoulli or binomial processes; the exception is the distribution of offspring number. Using clutch and litter size distributions from 53 vertebrate species, we demonstrate that among-individual variability in offspring number can usually be described by the generalized Poisson distribution. Our model framework allows the demographic variance to be calculated from underlying biological processes and can easily be linked to models of environmental stochasticity or selection because of its parametric structure. In addition, it reveals that the distributions of ARS are often multimodal and skewed, with implications for extinction risk and evolution in small populations. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Clutch size distributions; Demographic stochasticity; Generalized Poisson distribution; Litter size distributions; Nesting success; Reproductive success","clutch size; demographic method; extinction risk; genotype; litter size; neonate; nesting success; persistence; Poisson ratio; reproductive success; stochasticity; survival; animal; article; biological model; clutch size; population dynamics; reproduction; sexual behavior; statistics; Animals; Clutch Size; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Stochastic Processes; Vertebrata",,,,,,"Akçakaya, H.R., A method for simulating demographic sto-chasticity (1991) Ecological Modelling, 54, pp. 133-136; Estimating the variance of survival rates and fecundities (2002) Animal Conservation, 5, pp. 333-336; Using models for species conservation and management (2004) Species Conservation and Management: Case Studies, pp. 3-14. , H.

Phenotypic plasticity and developmental variation provide a means for plants to cope with variable herbivory. We characterized the genetics of developmental variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Mimulus guttatus; Optimal defense theory; Phenotype plasticity; QTL; Trade-off; Trichomes","dicotyledon; genotype; herbivory; insect; phenotypic plasticity; plant defense; trade-off; trichome; animal; article; feeding behavior; genetics; immunology; insect; Mimulus; phenotype; plant epidermis; quantitative trait locus; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Insects; Mimulus; Phenotype; Plant Epidermis; Quantitative Trait Loci; Hexapoda; Mimulus (angiosperm); Mimulus guttatus",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Plant defense and density dependence in the population growth of herbivores (2004) American Naturalist, 164, pp. 113-120; Agren, J., Schemske., D.W., The cost of defense against herbivores: An experimental study of trichome production in Bras-sica rapa (1993) American Naturalist, 141, pp. 338-350; Beardsley, P.M., Olmstead., R.G., Redefining Phrymaceae: The placement of Mimulus, tribe Mimuleae, and Phryma (2002) American Journal of Botany, 89, pp. 1093-1102; Berenbaum, M.R., Patterns of furanocoumarin production and insect herbivory in a population of wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa L.)

Longitudinal observations on the blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) revealed a quadratic effect of female age on fledgling production and cohort differences in rate of reproductive decline. By swapping clutches between females of different ages, we tested whether reproductive senescence is due to decline in egg quality or capacity to care. As laying mothers aged, egg size, ulna length of 5-day-old chicks, and ulna growth of second chicks up to age 30 days declined, and as rearing mothers aged, ulna growth and cellular mediated immune response of second chicks diminished. Oddly, senescent females (>11 years) produced more fledglings when rearing offspring of middle-aged females (8-11 years) than when rearing offspring of senescent or young females. Thus, senescence reduced egg quality and rearing capacities, and reproductive success of senescent mothers depended on prenatal effects associated with the age of the laying mother. Reproductive senescence of boobies may involve constraints on resources allocated to reproduction as well as adaptive adjustment of provision and care according to offspring value, implying that negative effects of senescence on offspring survival can be ameliorated by plasticity in postlaying or postnatal care. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Age-dependent maternal investment; Maternal effects; Senescence; Sula nebouxii","aging; cohort analysis; egg; fledging; maternal effect; parental care; rearing; seabird; senescence; aging; animal; article; bird; body size; cytology; female; longitudinal study; lymphocyte activation; maternal behavior; newborn; oocyte; oviparity; physiology; Aging; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Birds; Body Size; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Lymphocyte Activation; Maternal Behavior; Oviparity; Ovum; Aves; Sula nebouxii; Sulidae",,,,,,"Beckerman, A.P., Benton, T.G., Lapsley, C.T., Koesters., N., Talkin' 'bout my generation: Environmental variability and cohort effects (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 754-767; Beckman, K.B., Ames., B.N., The free radical theory of aging matures (1998) Physiological Reviews, 78, pp. 547-581; Bennett, P.M., Owens., I.P.F., (2002) Evolutionary Ecology of Birds: Life Histories, Mating Systems and Extinction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bize, P., Roulin, A., Richner., H., Covariation between egg size and rearing condition determines offspring quality: An experiment with the alpine swift (2002) Oecologia (Berlin), 132, pp. 231-234; Blount, J., Houston, D., Møller., A.P., Why egg yolk is yellow (2000) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 15, pp. 47-49; Bogdanova, M.I., Nager, R.G., Monaghan., P., (2006) Does Parental Age Affect Offspring Performance Through Differences in Egg Quality?

The mechanisms that protect these organisms from extinction due to accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of sexual recombination are unclear. Glomeromycota reproduce by spores containing hundreds of nuclei, which represents a departure from the typical eukaryotic developmental pattern, where a multicellular organism is re-created from a uninucleate propagule. To understand whether the multinucleate spore makeup may have contributed to the evolutionary success of Glomeromycota, we examined the dynamics of spore nuclei in Glomus etunicatum using live threedimensional imaging and mathematical models. We show that the spores are populated by an influx of a stream of nuclei from the surrounding mycelium rather than by divisions of a single founder nucleus. We present evidence that mechanisms of selection are likely to operate at the level of individual nuclei. On the basis of mathematical analyses of the effects that these nuclear dynamics have on the population mutation load, we postulate that the developmental patterns of sporogenesis have adaptive significance for moderating the accumulation of deleterious mutations and may have contributed to the evolutionary longevity of Glomeromycota. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Deleterious mutations; Glomus etunicatum; Mutation load; Selection; Sporogenesis","arbuscular mycorrhiza; longevity; mutation; propagule; sexual reproduction; spore; symbiont; article; cell nucleus; cytology; fungus spore; genetic load; genetic selection; genetics; Glomeromycota; growth, development and aging; mycelium; physiology; Cell Nucleus; Genetic Load; Glomeromycota; Mycelium; Selection, Genetic; Spores, Fungal; Arbuscular; Bacteria (microorganisms); Embryophyta; Eukaryota; Fungi; Glomeromycota; Glomus; Glomus etunicatum",,,,,,"Aist, J.R., Mitotic apparatus in fungi, Ceratocystis fagacearum and Fusarium oxysporum (1969) Journal of Cell Biology, 40, pp. 120-135; Alexopoulos, C.J., Mims, C.W., Blackwell., M., (1996) Introductory Mycology, , Wiley, New York; Bago, B., Zipfel, W., Williams, R.M., Chamberland, H., Lafon-Taine, J.G., Webb, W.W., Piché., Y., In vivo studies on the nuclear behavior of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora rosea grown under axenic conditions (1998) Protoplasma, 203, pp. 1-15; Bartnicki-Garcia, S., Hemmes., D.E., Some aspects of the form and function of oomycete spores (1976) The Fungal Spore, pp. 593-639. , D.

We provide evidence from comparative analyses that an ecological factor (breeding pool size) is associated with the evolution of parental care across all frogs. We further show that the most intensive form of parental care (trophic egg feeding) evolved in concert with the use of small pools for tadpole deposition and that egg feeding was associated with the evolution of biparental care. Previous research on two Peruvian poison frogs (Ranitomeya imitator and Ranitomeya variabilis) revealed similar life histories, with the exception of breeding pool size. This key ecological difference led to divergence in parental care patterns and mating systems. We present ecological field experiments that demonstrate that biparental care is essential to tadpole survival in small (but not large) pools. Field observations demonstrate social monogamy in R. imitator, the species that uses small pools. Molecular analyses demonstrate genetic monogamy in R. imitator, the first example of genetic monogamy in an amphibian. In total, this evidence constitutes the most complete documentation to date that a single ecological factor drove the evolution of biparental care and genetic and social monogamy in an animal. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Dendrobatidae; Frogs; Mating systems; Parental care; Ranitomeya; Sexual selection","comparative study; frog; monogamy; parental care; reproductive strategy; sexual selection; animal; article; Bromeliaceae; comparative study; ecosystem; evolution; female; frogs and toads; genetics; Heliconiaceae; male; maternal behavior; oocyte; paternal behavior; physiology; sexual behavior; Animals; Anura; Bromeliaceae; Ecosystem; Evolution; Female; Heliconiaceae; Male; Maternal Behavior; Ovum; Pair Bond; Paternal Behavior; Amphibia; Animalia; Anura; Dendrobatidae",,,,,,"Ah-King, M., Kvarnemo, C., Tullberg., B.S., The influence of territoriality and mating system on the evolution of male care: A phylogenetic study on fish (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 371-382; Arnold, S.J., Duvall., D., Animal mating systems: A synthesis based on selection theory (1994) American Naturalist, 143, pp. 317-348; Bell, W.J., Roth, L.M., Nalepa., C.A., (2007) Cockroaches: Ecology, Behavior, and Natural History, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore; Bickford, D.P., Differential parental care behaviors of arboreal and terrestrial microhylid frogs from Papua New Guinea (2004) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 55, pp. 402-409; Bourne, G.R., Collins, A.C., Holder, A.M., McCarthy., M.L., Vocal communication and reproductive behavior of the frog Colostethus beebei in Guyana (2001) Journal of Herpetology, 35, pp. 272-281; Brown, J.L., Morales, V., Summers., K., Divergence in parental care, habitat selection and larval life history between two species of Peruvian poison frogs: An experimental analysis (2008) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 21, pp. 1534-1543; Brown, J.L., Twomey, E., Morales, V., Summers., K., Phy-totelm size in relation to parental care and mating strategies in two species of Peruvian poison frogs (2008) Behaviour, 145, pp. 1139-1165. , doi:10.1007/s12686-009-9036-5; Brown, J.L., Choteau, M., Glenn, T., Summers., K., The development and analysis of twenty-one microsatellite loci for three species of Amazonian poison frogs (2009) Conservation Genetics Resources, 1, pp. 149-151; Brown, J.L., Morales, V., Summers., K., Home range size and location in relation to reproductive resources in poison frogs: A Monte Carlo approach using GIS data (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 547-554; Tactical reproductive parasitism via larval cannibalism in Peruvian poison frogs (2009) Biology Letters, 5, pp. 148-153; Burley, N.T., Johnson., K., The evolution of avian parental care (2002) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 357, pp. 241-250; Caldwell, J.P., Pair bonding in spotted poison frogs (1997) Nature, 385, p. 211; Caldwell, J.P., De, V.R.L.Oliveira., Determinants of bi-parental care in the spotted poison frog Dendrobates vanzolinii (Anura: Dendrobatidae) (1999) Copeia, 1999, pp. 565-575; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Crump, M.L., (1974) Reproductive Strategies in A Tropical Anuran Community, , University of Kansas Museum of Natural History Miscellaneous Publication no. 61; Duellman, W.E., Trueb., L., (1986) Biology of Amphibians, , McGraw-Hill, San Francisco; Frost, D.R., (2009) Amphibian Species of the World: An Online Reference, , http://research.amnh.org/herpetology/amphibia/, Version 5.3.

Despite extensive study, the mechanisms regulating savanna tree populations are not well understood. Recent empirical work suggests that both tree-tree competition and fire are key factors in semiarid to mesic savannas, but the potential for competition to structure savannas, particularly in interaction with fire, has received little theoretical attention. We develop a minimalistic and analytically tractable stochastic cellular automaton to study the individual and combined effects of these two factors on savannas. We find that while competition often substantially depresses tree density, fire generally has little effect but can drive tree extinction in extreme scenarios. When combined, competition and fire interact nonlinearly with strong negative consequences for tree density. This novel result may help explain observed variability among apparently similar savannas in their response to fire. Paradoxically, this interaction could also render the presence of competition more difficult to detect in empirical studies because fire can override the characteristic regular spacing driven by competition and lead instead to clustering. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Establishment; Grass-dependent fire; Mean-field approximation; Nonlinear interaction; Pair approximation; Spatially explicit model","biodiversity; cluster analysis; competition (ecology); economic analysis; extinction; fire behavior; geographical variation; population structure; savanna; semiarid region; terrestrial ecosystem",,,,,,"Barot, S., Gignoux, J., Menaut., J.-C., Demography of a savanna palm tree: Predictions from comprehensive spatial pattern analyses (1999) Ecology, 80, pp. 1987-2005; Baxter, P.W.J., Getz., W.M., A model-framed evaluation of elephant effects on tree and fire dynamics in African savannas (2005) Ecological Applications, 15, pp. 1331-1341; Belsky, A.J., Influences of trees on savanna productivity: Tests of shade, nutrients, and tree-grass competition (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 922-932; Belsky, A.J., Amundson, R.G., Duxbury, J.M., Riha, S.J., Ali, A.R., Mwonga., S.M., The effects of trees on their physical, chemical and biological environments in a semi-arid savanna in Kenya (1989) Journal of Applied Ecology, 26, pp. 1005-1024; Belsky, A.J., Mwonga, S.M., Amundson, R.G., Duxbury, J.M., Ali., A.R., Comparative effects of isolated trees on their undercanopy environments in high-and low-rainfall savannas (1993) Journal of Applied Ecology, 30, pp. 143-155; Boaler, S.B., Sciwale., K.C., Ecology of a Miombo site, Lupa North Forest Reserve, Tanzania.

However, when the survival of young from independence to maturity is separated from parental reproductive success, optimized parental investment is proportional, instead, to prereproductive survival when reproductive and nonreproductive components of adult mortality are additive (simultaneous risk) or to the ratio of prereproductive survival to adult nonreproductive survival when the adult mortality components are multiplicative (independent risk). Applied to the lower, and largely nonoverlapping, brood sizes of tropical compared to temperate and boreal birds, estimates of both adult and prereproductive survival do not predict different levels of reproductive investment. Accordingly, the pervasive increase in clutch size with latitude would appear to reflect increasing availability of food resources to provision offspring. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Adaptation; Bird; Clutch size; Demography; Life-history theory; Optimality theory","adaptation; bird; Boreal; brood size; demography; evolutionary biology; food supply; life history; mortality; optimum foraging theory; parental investment; reproductive success; survival; Aves",,,,,,"Adams, A.A.Y., Skagen, S.K., Savidge., J.A., Modeling post-fledging survival of lark buntings in response to ecological and biological factors (2006) Ecology, 87, pp. 178-188; Anders, A.D., Dearborn, D.C., Faaborg, J., Thompson., F.R., Juvenile survival in a population of Neotropical migrant birds (1997) Conservation Biology, 11, pp. 698-707; Andersson, M., Wiklund, C.G., Rundgren., H., Parental defence of offspring: A model and an example (1980) Animal Behaviour, 87, pp. 367-373; Ashmole, N.P., The regulation of numbers of tropical oceanic birds (1963) Ibis, 103, pp. 458-473; Askenmo, C., Reproductive effort and return rate of male pied flycatchers (1979) American Naturalist, 114, pp. 748-753; Bennett, P.M., Owens., I.P.F., (2002) Evolutionary Ecology of Birds: Life Histories, Mating Systems and Extinction, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Blake, J.G., Loiselle., B.A., Estimates of apparent survival rate for forest birds in eastern Ecuador (2008) Biotropica, 40, pp. 485-493; Bokony, V., Lendvai, A.Z., Liker, A., Angelier, F., Wingfield, J.C., Chastel., O., Stress response and the value of reproduction: Are birds prudent parents (2009) American Naturalist, 173, pp. 589-598; Botkin, D.B., Miller., R.S., Mortality rates and survival of birds (1974) American Naturalist, 108, pp. 181-192; Briskie, J.V., Martin, P.R., Martin., T.E., Nest predation and the evolution of nestling begging calls (1999) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 266, pp. 2153-2159; Case, T.J., On the evolution and adaptive significance of postnatal growth rates in the terrestrial vertebrates (1978) Quarterly Review of Biology, 53, pp. 243-282; Charlesworth, B., Léon., J.A., The relation of reproductive effort to age (1976) American Naturalist, 110, pp. 449-459; Charnov, E.L., (1993) Life History Invariants: Some Explorations of Symmetry in Evolutionary Biology, , Oxford University Press, New York; Charnov, E.L., Krebs., J.R., On clutch-size and fitness (1974) Ibis, 116, pp. 217-219; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The Evolution of Parental Care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Cody, M.L., A general theory of clutch size (1966) Evolution, 20, pp. 174-184; (1971) Ecological Aspects of Reproduction, pp. 461-512. , D.

Barraclough, T.G.","Area is generally assumed to affect speciation rates, but work on the spatial context of speciation has focused mostly on patterns of range overlap between emerging species rather than on questions of geographical scale. A variety of geographical theories of speciation predict that the probability of speciation occurring within a given region should (1) increase with the size of the region and (2) increase as the spatial extent of intraspecific gene flow becomes smaller. Using a survey of speciation events on isolated oceanic islands for a broad range of taxa, we find evidence for both predictions. The probability of in situ speciation scales with island area in bats, carnivorous mammals, birds, flowering plants, lizards, butterflies and moths, and snails. Ferns are an exception to these findings, but they exhibit high frequencies of polyploid and hybrid speciation, which are expected to be scale independent. Furthermore, the minimum island size for speciation correlates across groups with the strength of intraspecific gene flow, as is estimated from a meta-analysis of published population genetic studies. These results indicate a general geographical model of speciation rates that are dependent on both area and gene flow. The spatial scale of population divergence is an important but neglected determinant of broad-scale diversity patterns. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Gene flow; Oceanic islands; Spatial scale; Speciation","biodiversity; evolutionary biology; gene flow; geographical variation; in situ measurement; island biogeography; meta-analysis; model test; polyploidy; scale effect; spatial analysis; speciation (biology); taxonomy; Aves; Filicophyta; Gastropoda; Lepidoptera; Magnoliophyta; Mammalia; Squamata",,,,,,"Ackerman, J.D., Trejo-Torres, J.C., Crespo-Chuy., Y., Orchids of the West Indies: Predictability of diversity and endemism (2007) Journal of Biogeography, 34, pp. 779-786; (2008) Australian Biological Resources Study, , http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/flora/ 50/index.html, Canberra Flora of Australia online: oceanic islands excluding Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands; Barluenga, M., Stolting, K., Salzburger, W., Muschick, M., Meyer., A., Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish (2006) Nature, 439, pp. 719-723; Barraclough, T.G., Vogler., A.P., Detecting the geographical pattern of speciation from species-level phylogenies (2000) American Naturalist, 155, pp. 419-434; Barraclough, T.G., Harvey, P.H., Nee., S., Sexual selection and taxonomic diversity in passerine birds (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 259, pp. 211-215; Barton, N.H., The evolutionary consequences of gene flow and local adaptation: Future approaches (2001) Dispersal, pp. 329-340. , J.

Here, we provide a unique example of a transgenerational maternal effect in antipredator behavior that takes the form of a ""warning"" about predators that female fall field crickets Gryllus pennsylvanicus transmit to their offspring. Specifically, the offspring of gravid crickets exposed to a wolf spider Hogna helluo exhibit greater antipredator immobility in response to Hogna chemical cues than do offspring of nonexposed females. These ""forewarned"" crickets exhibit greater survival in the presence of Hogna than do those not forewarned. Accordingly, gravid crickets from areas with significant Hogna populations produce offspring that are more responsive to Hogna cues than do those from nearby Hogna-free areas. Such transgenerational maternal effects may be more common than currently realized. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Antipredator behavior; Chemical cues; Crickets; Maternal effects; Wolf spiders","antipredator defense; behavioral ecology; chemical cue; cricket; maternal effect; population density; predation risk; spider; survival; Araneae; Gryllidae; Gryllinae; Gryllus pennsylvanicus; Hogna; Hogna helluo; Lycosidae",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Specificity of induced resistance in wild radish: Causes and consequences for two specialist and two generalist caterpillars (2000) Oikos, 89, pp. 493-500; Agrawal, A.A., Laforsch, C., Tollrian., R., Transgenerational induction of defences in animals and plants (1999) Nature, 401, pp. 60-63; Andersen, D.H., Pertoldi, C., Scali, V., Loeschcke., V., Heat stress and age induced maternal effects on wing size and shape in parthenogenetic Drosophila mercatorum (2005) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 18, pp. 884-892; Bailey, W.J., Haythornthwaite, S., Risks of calling by the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus: Potential predation by Australian long-eared bats (1998) Journal of Zoology, 244, pp. 505-513; Biard, C., Surai, P.F., Møller., A.P., An analysis of pre-and post-hatching maternal effects mediated by carotenoids in the blue tit (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20, pp. 326-339; Bossdorf, O., Richards, C.L., Pigliucci., M., Epigenetics for ecologists (2008) Ecology Letters, 11, pp. 106-115; Crews, D., Gore, A.C., Hsu, T.S., Dangleben, N.L., Spinetta, M., Schallert, T., Anway, M.D., Skinner., M.K., Transgenerational epigenetic imprints on mate preference (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 104, pp. 5942-5946; Curio, E., Ernst, U., Vieth., W., Cultural transmission of enemy recognition: One function of mobbing (1978) Science, 202, pp. 899-901; Fish, E.W., Shahrokh, D., Bagot, R., Caldji, C., Bredy, T., Szyf, M., Meaney., M.J., Epigenetic programming of stress responses through variations in maternal care (2004) Youth Violence: Scientific Approaches to Prevention, pp. 167-180. , J.

From a population dynamics perspective, spatial mate-finding problems are well studied, and decreased mate-finding efficiency at low population densities is a well-recognized mechanism for the Allee effect. Temporal aspects of mate finding have been rarely considered, but reproductive asynchrony may engender an Allee effect in which some females go mateless by virtue of temporal isolation. Here we develop and explore a model that unifies previously disparate theoretical considerations of spatial and temporal aspects of mate finding. Specifically, we develop a two-sex reaction-diffusion system to examine the interplay between reproductive asynchrony and the dispersal of individuals out of a patch. We also consider additional behavioral complications, including several alternative functional forms for mating efficiency and advective movements in which males actively seek out females. By calculating the fraction of females expected to go mateless as a joint function of reproductive asynchrony and patch size, we find that the population-level reproductive rates necessary to offset female matelessness may be quite high. These results suggest that Allee effects engendered by reproductive asynchrony will be greatly exacerbated in spatially isolated populations. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Age-dependent male reproductive success; Critical patch size; Demographically effective population density; Densitydependent mating success; Mate-searching behavior; Two-sex population model","Allee effect; behavioral ecology; demographic method; density dependence; dispersal; gene flow; isolated population; mate location; mate recognition; patch size; population growth; population modeling; reproductive success; spatial distribution; temporal period",,,,,,"Augspurger, C.K., Reproductive synchrony of a tropical shrub: Experimental studies on effects of pollinators and seed predators on Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) (1981) Ecology, 62, pp. 775-788; Barrows, E.M., Mating behavior in halictine bees (Hymen-optera: Halictidae): Copulatory behavior and olfactory communication (1975) Insectes Sociaux, 22, pp. 307-331; Berwaerts, K., Aerts, P., Van, H.Dyck., On the sex-specific mechanisms of butterfly flight: Flight performance relative to flight morphology, wing kinematics, and sex in Pararge aegeria (2006) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 89, pp. 675-687; Boukal, D.S., Berec., L., Single-species models of the Allee effect: Extinction boundaries, sex ratios, and mate encounters (2002) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 218, pp. 375-394; Bullock, S.H., Bawa., K.S., Sexual dimorphism and the annual flowering pattern in Jacaratia dolichaula (D.

Individual differences in dispersal behavior may be correlated with other traits that determine the impact individuals have on patches they colonize. We established habitat patches-artificial pools-across a landscape, and these pools were naturally colonized by dragonfly larvae. Larvae were collected from pools at different levels of isolation and held under common lab conditions for 5 months. We then compared larval foraging rates. Foraging rate was positively related to habitat isolation, and colonists from the most isolated artificial pools had significantly higher foraging rates than individuals from the least isolated pools. Our results indicate that spatial patterns in colonist behavior can develop across a landscape independent of species-level dispersal limitation. This finding suggests that studies of community structure across space should include an assessment of the distribution of phenotypes as well as species-level dispersal limitation patterns. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Colonization; Foraging rate; Patch isolation; Predation","colonization; community structure; dispersal; dragonfly; foraging behavior; habitat type; interspecific variation; isolated population; laboratory method; landscape change; larval development; patch dynamics; phenotype; predation; Anisoptera (dragonflies)",,,,,,"Barbraud, C., Johnson, A.R., Bertault., G., Phenotypic correlates of post-fledging dispersal in a population of greater flamingos: The importance of body condition (2003) Journal of Animal Ecology, 72, pp. 246-257; Benard, M.F., McCauley., S.J., Integrating across life-history stages: Consequences of natal habitat effects on dispersal (2008) American Naturalist, 171, pp. 553-567; Benke, A.C., Huryn, A.D., Smock, L.A., Wallace., J.B., Length-mass relationships for freshwater macroinvertebrates in North America with particular reference to the southeastern United States (1999) Journal of the North American Benthological Society, 18, pp. 308-343; Broomhall, S.D., Egg temperature modifies predator avoidance and the effects of the insecticide endosulfan on tadpoles of an Australian frog (2004) Journal of Applied Ecology, 41, pp. 105-113; Clobert, J., Le Galliard, J.-F., Cote, J., Meylan, S., Massot., M., Informed dispersal, heterogeneity in animal dispersal syndromes and the dynamics of spatially structured populations (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 197-209; Conrad, K.F., Willson, K.H., Whitfield, K., Harvey, I.F., Thomas, C.J., Sherratt., C.J., Characteristics of dispersing Ischnura elegans and Coenagrion puella (Odonata): Age, sex, size, morph and ectoparasitism (2002) Ecography, 25, pp. 439-445; Cote, J., Clobert., J., Social personalities influence natal dispersal in a lizard (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274, pp. 383-390; Crooks, K.R., Sanjayan., M., (2006) Connectivity Conservation, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Dingemanse, N.J., Both, C., Van Noordwijk, A.J., Rutten, A.L., Drent., P.J., Natal dispersal and personalities in great tits (Parus major) (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 270, pp. 741-747; Doligez, B., Pärt., T., Timating fitness consequences of dispersal: A road t ""know- where""? non-random dispersal and the underestimation of dispersers' fitness (2008) Journal of Animal Ecology, 77, pp. 1199-1211; Duckworth, R.A., Behavioral correlations across breeding contexts provide a mechanism for a cost of aggression (2006) Behavioral Ecology, 17, pp. 1011-1019; Duckworth, R.A., Badyaev., A.V., Coupling of dispersal and aggression facilitates the rapid range expansion of a passerine bird (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 104, pp. 15017-15022; Hanski, I., (1999) Metapopulation Ecology.

We use geometric morphometrics to quantify the diversity of skull shape in 106 breeds of domestic dog, in three wild canid species, and across the order Carnivora. The amount of shape variation among domestic dogs far exceeds that in wild species, and it is comparable to the disparity throughout the Carnivora. The greatest shape distances between dog breeds clearly surpass the maximum divergence between species in the Carnivora. Moreover, domestic dogs occupy a range of novel shapes outside the domain of wild carnivorans. The disparity among companion dogs substantially exceeds that of other classes of breeds, suggesting that relaxed functional demands facilitated diversification. Much of the diversity of dog skull shapes stems from variation between short and elongate skulls and from modularity of the face versus that of the neurocranium. These patterns of integration and modularity apply to variation among individuals and breeds, but they also apply to fluctuating asymmetry, indicating they have a shared developmental basis. These patterns of variation are also found for the wolf and across the Carnivora, suggesting that they existed before the domestication of dogs and are not a result of selective breeding. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Canis familiaris; Carnivora; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Novelty; Selection","canid; carnivore; domestic species; evolutionary biology; functional morphology; geographical variation; morphometry; natural selection; neurology; reproductive behavior; skull; species diversity; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Carnivora",,,,,,"Arthur, W., Developmental drive: An important determinant of the direction of phenotypic evolution (2001) Evolution and Development, 3, pp. 271-278; Bininda-Emonds, O.R.P., Cardillo, M., Jones, K.E., MacPhee, R.D.E., Beck, R.M.D., Grenyer, R., Price, S.A., Purvis., A., The delayed rise of present-day mammals (2007) Nature, 446, pp. 507-512; Björnerfeldt, S., Webster, M.T., Vilà, C., Relaxation of selective constraint on dog mitochondrial DNA following domestication (2006) Genome Research, 16, pp. 990-994; Björnerfeldt, S., Hailer, F., Nord, M., Vilà, C., Assortative mating and fragmentation within dog breeds (2008) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8, p. 28; Breuker, C.J., Patterson, J.S., Klingenberg., C.P., A single basis for developmental buffering of Drosophila wing shape (2006) PLoS ONE, 1, pp. e7; Calboli, F.C.F., Sampson, J., Fretwell, N., Balding., D.J., Population structure and inbreeding from pedigree analysis of purebred dogs (2008) Genetics, 179, pp. 593-601; Chase, K., Carrier, D.R., Adler, F.R., Jarvik, T., Ostrander, E.A., Lorentzen, T.D., Lark., K.G., Genetic basis for systems of skeletal quantitative traits: Principal component analysis of the canid skeleton (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 99, pp. 9930-9935; Cheverud, J.M., Quantitative genetics and developmental constraints on evolution by selection (1984) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 110, pp. 155-171; Christiansen, P., Evolution of skull and mandible shape in cats (Carnivora: Felidae) (2008) PLoS ONE, 3, pp. e2807; Clutton-Brock, J., Origins of the dog: Domestication and early history (1995) The Domestic Dog: Its Evolution, Behaviour and Interactions with People, pp. 7-20. , Serpell, ed Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Coppinger, R., Coppinger., L., (2001) Dogs: A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior, and Evolution, , Scribner, New York; Cruz, F., Vilà, C., Webster., M.T., The legacy of domestication: Accumulation of deleterious mutations in the dog genome (2008) Molecular Biology and Evolution, 25, pp. 2331-2336; Darwin, C., (1868) Animals and Plants under Domestication, 1. , J.

We add mutualism to a well-known model of resource competition and show that it can powerfully stabilize competitive coexistence in the absence or presence of resource heterogeneity. We use a transition matrix approach to describe lottery competition, while allowing each of two competitors to affect the population dynamics of their shared resource. For example, two plant-defending ant species may compete for nesting space within ant-adapted (myrmecophytic) plants. We show that mutualism between consumers and a resource species can stabilize competitive coexistence of the consumers by allowing each competitor to influence resource dynamics in a way that benefits the other. The effect of this novel coexistence mechanism depends on a mutualism's biological details: for example, altering myrmecophyte fecundity affects competing ant species differently than does altering plant survival. Finally, we consider a heterogeneous resource (e.g., two types of nest site) and show how niche partitioning can stabilize coexistence in the absence of resource dynamics. When resource heterogeneity is dynamic (e.g., small and large plants of the same species), niche partitioning also provides new routes for additional stabilization via mutualism. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Competition; Demographic structure; Lottery model; Mutualism; Myrmecophytes; Niche differentiation","ant; coexistence; competition (ecology); demography; ecological modeling; epiphyte; fecundity; heterogeneity; interspecific interaction; living resource; model test; mutualism; myrmecophyte; niche partitioning; population density",,,,,,"Addicott, J.F., Regulation of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths: Population level processes (1998) Oikos, 81, pp. 119-129; Alizon, S., Transmission-recovery trade-offs to study parasite evolution (2008) American Naturalist, 172, pp. E113-E121; Alizon, S., Hurford, A., Mideo, N., Van, M.Baalen., Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: History, current state of affairs and the future (2009) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 22, pp. 245-259; Amarasekare, P., Spatial variance and density-dependent dispersal in competitive coexistence (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 271, pp. 1497-1506; Arnold, A.E., Mejia, L.C., Kyllo, D., Rojas, E.I., Maynard, Z., Robbins, N., Herre., E.A., Fungal endophytes limit pathogen damage in a tropical tree (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 100, pp. 15649-15654; Bronstein, J.L., Our current understanding of mutualism (1994) Quarterly Review of Biology, 69, pp. 31-51; The contribution of ant-plant protection studies to our understanding of mutualism (1998) Biotropica, 30, pp. 150-161; Bronstein, J.L., Wilson, W.G., Morris., W.F., Ecological dynamics of mutualist/antagonist communities (2003) American Naturalist, 2 (SUPPL.), pp. S24-S39; Brown, J.S., Habitat selection as an evolutionary game (1990) Evolution, 44, pp. 732-746; Bruna, E.M., Lapola, D.M., Vasconcelos., H.L., Interspecific variation in the defensive responses of obligate plant-ants: Experimental tests and consequences for herbivory (2004) Oecologia (Berlin), 138, pp. 558-565; Bruna, E.M., Vasconcelos, H.L., Heredia., S., The effect of habitat fragmentation on communities of mutualists: Amazonian ants and their host plants (2005) Biological Conservation, 124, pp. 209-216; Bruno, J.F., Stachowicz, J.J., Bertness., M.D., Inclusion of facilitation into ecological theory (2003) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 18, pp. 119-125; Chesson, P., A need for niches?

One of the clearest potential examples of spite is the costly production and release of toxins called bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are toxins produced by bacteria that can kill closely related strains of the same species. Theoretical work has predicted that bacteriocin-mediated interactions could play an important role in maintaining local genetic and/or species diversity, but these interactions have not been studied at biologically relevant scales in nature. Here we studied toxin production and among-strain inhibitions in a natural population of Xenorhabdus bovienii. We found genetic differences and inhibitions between colonies that were collected only a few meters apart.

Despite the clear effect of sex differences on sex ratios and population growth rates, demographic models rarely consider both sexes explicitly. Here I explore the causes of extreme female-biased sex ratios in two marine angiosperms (Phyllospadix spp.). Using demographic data, I develop twosex matrix projection models to assess the magnitude of demographic differences necessary to generate observed sex ratios and the consequences of sex differences for population growth rates. I demonstrate that small sex differences in survival can generate biased sex ratios, but the importance of sexual reproduction differs markedly between species. Even in the absence of a direct trade-off between sexual and asexual reproduction, the presence of two reproductive modes affects both the importance of sex and the sex-ratio bias. Using sensitivity analyses, I quantify the contribution of shared and sex-specific vital rates and show that until males become rare, the sensitivity of sex-specific vital rates is small relative to that of shared vital rates. I demonstrate that placing sex differences in the context of a demographic model that includes biologically motivated lifehistory trade-offs can explain the maintenance of sex-specific life histories and the persistence of skewed sex ratios. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Phyllospadix; Seagrass; Sex ratio; Sexspecific population dynamics; Sexual dimorphism; Two-sex matrix model","demographic method; evolutionary biology; life cycle; perennial plant; population growth; population modeling; seagrass; sensitivity analysis; sex ratio; sex-related difference; survival; trade-off; Magnoliophyta; Phyllospadix",,,,,,"Arnqvist, G., Rowe., L., (2005) Sexual Conflict.

The presumed explanation is that high-latitude/ altitude organisms have evolved greater acclimation ability because of exposure to greater temperature fluctuations. Using a conceptual model of the thermal environment during the reproductive season, we tested this hypothesis against an alternative that plasticity is greater because of increased exposure to specific temperatures that strongly select for thermal acclimation. We examined geographic variation in floral reflectance/color plasticity among 29 European populations of a widespread perennial herb, Plantago lanceolata. Individuals partially thermoregulate reproduction through temperature-sensitive plasticity in floral reflectance/color. Plasticity was positively correlated with latitude and altitude. Path analyses support the hypothesis that the thermal environment mediates these geographic effects. Plasticity declined as seasonal temperature range increased, and it increased as duration of the growing season shortened and as the proportion of time exposed to temperatures favoring thermoregulation increased. Data provide evidence that floral re-flectance/color plasticity is adaptive and that it has evolved in response not to the magnitude of temperature variation during the reproductive season but rather to the relative exposure to low temperatures, which favor thermoregulation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Ectotherm; Floral reflectance; Geographic variation; Phenotypic plasticity; Plantago lanceolata; Thermal acclimation","acclimation; adaptive radiation; color; ectothermy; evolutionary biology; functional morphology; geographical variation; growing season; herb; hypothesis testing; model test; perennial plant; phenotypic plasticity; population density; reflectance; temperature effect; thermoregulation; Plantago; Plantago lanceolata",,,,,,"Addo-Bediako, A., Chown, S.L., Gaston., K.J., Thermal tolerance, climatic variability and latitude (2000) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 267, pp. 739-745; Angilletta, M.J., Bennett, A.F., Guderley, H., Navas, C.A., Seebacher, F., Wilson, R.S., Coadaptation: A unifying principle in evolutionary thermal biology (2006) Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 79, pp. 282-294; Arnold, S.J., Peterson., C.R., A model for optimal reaction norms: The case of the pregnant garter snake and her temperature-sensitive embryos (2002) American Naturalist, 160, pp. 306-316; Atkin, O.K., Bruhn, D., Hurry, V.M., Tjoelker., M.G., The hot and the cold: Unravelling the variable response of plant respiration to temperature (2005) Functional Plant Biology, 32, pp. 87-105; Bentler, P.M., (1989) EQS Structural Equations Program Manual, , BMDP Statistical Software, Los Angeles; Blouin-Demers, G., Nadeau., P., The cost-benefit model of thermoregulation does not predict lizard thermoregulatory behavior (2005) Ecology, 86, pp. 560-566; Bonnier, G., Flahault., C., Observations sur les modifications des végétaux (1878) Annales des Sciences Naturelles Botanique, 7, pp. 93-125; (1878) Sur les Variations Qui Se Produisent Avec la Latitude dans Une Même Espèce Végétale., 25, pp. 300-306. , Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France; Callahan, H.S., Dhanoolal, N., Ungerer., M.C., Plasticity genes and plasticity costs: A new approach using an Arabidopsis recombinant inbred population (2005) New Phytologist, 166, pp. 129-139; Caruso, C.M., Maherali, H., Sherrard., M., Plasticity of physiology in Lobelia: Testing for adaptation and constraint (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 980-990; Collinge, J.E., Hoffmann, A.A., McKechnie., S.W., Alti-tudinal patterns for latitudinally varying traits and polymorphic markers in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia (2006) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 19, pp. 473-482; Covey-Crump, E.M., Attwood, R.G., Atkin., O.K., Regulation of root respiration in two species of Plantago that differ in relative growth rate: The effect of short-and long-term changes in temperature (2002) Plant Cell and Environment, 25, pp. 1501-1513; Cunningham, S.C., Read., J., Comparison of temperate and tropical rainforest tree species: Photosynthetic responses to growth temperature (2002) Oecologia (Berlin), 133, pp. 112-119; Davies, P., Gibbons., B., Field guide to wild flowers of southern Europe (1993) Crowood, Ramsbury; Deutsch, C.A., Tewksbury, J.J., Huey, R.B., Sheldon, K.S., Ghalambor, C.K., Haak, D.C., Martin., P.R., Impacts of climate warming on terrestrial ectotherms across latitude (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 105, pp. 6668-6672; Dewitt, T., Scheiner., S., (2004) Phenotypic Plasticity: Functional and Conceptual Approaches, , Oxford University Press, New York; Dewitt, T.J., Sih, A., Wilson., D.S., Costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity (1998) Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 13, pp. 77-81; Fitter, R., Fitter, A., Blamey., M., (1996) Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe, , Harper Collins, London; Flahault, C., Nouvelles observations sur les modifications des végétaux (1878) Annales des Sciences Naturelles Botanique, 9, pp. 159-207; Franks, S.J., Sim, S., Weis., A.E., Rapid evolution of flowering time by an annual plant in response to a climate fluctuation (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 104, pp. 1278-1282; Gabriel, W., Lynch., M., The selective advantage of reaction norms for environmental tolerance (1992) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 5, pp. 41-59; Gaston, K.J., Chown., S.L., Elevation and climatic tolerance: A test using dung beetles (1999) Oikos, 86, pp. 584-590; Gavrilets, S., Scheiner., S.M., The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. 5.

The model uses mean free-path-length theory to develop functional forms for two idealized behaviors of prey in patches. For congregating prey that maintain a fixed density, for example, fish schools, the predation rate has a ratio-dependent form, and predator interference depends only on predator density. For sessile prey, which maintain a fixed patch size, a new predator-dependent form emerges in which predator interference depends on both prey and predator densities. The Beddington-DeAngelis equation is a special case of the sessile form. The model provides behavioral and biological criteria with which to select the functional form and ranges of coefficients appropriate for a particular food web. Finally, the model illustrates that behavior is an essential factor in predator-prey dynamics. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Functional form; Optimal foraging; Patch-leaving criteria; Predator dependent; Predator-prey; Ratio dependent","behavioral ecology; ecological modeling; food web; foraging behavior; functional morphology; model test; optimum foraging theory; patch dynamics; predation; predator-prey interaction; animal; article; biological model; food chain; population dynamics; predation; Animals; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., The fallacies of ""ratio-dependent"" predation (1994) Ecology, 75, pp. 1842-1850; Anomalous predictions of ratio-dependent models of predation (1997) Oikos, 80, pp. 163-171; Habitat choice in predator-prey systems: Spatial instability due to interacting adaptive movements (2007) American Naturalist, 169, pp. 581-594; Measuring the impact of dynamic antipredator traits on predator-prey-resource interactions (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 1640-1649; Abrams, P.A., Ginzburg, L.R., The nature of predation: Prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither?

In turn, competing ejaculates often influence female promiscuity and fitness, for example, when ejaculate products increase female fecundity. Here we develop theory examining situations where males stimulate female fecundity and compete for fertilization and female remating is influenced by male fecundity stimulation. We consider the fitness consequences that fecundity stimulation has simultaneously for males inseminating the same female and for the female herself, and we show that the way fecundity increases with male stimulation shifts the coevolutionary dynamics of female remating and male ejaculate expenditure from conflict to cooperation among all mating partners. When fecundity stimulation is weak and males ""know"" their mating roles, the second male to inseminate a female can exploit the fecundity stimulation of the first male, fostering intra- and intersexual conflict over female remating. However, in a diversity of species where fecundity more than doubles with remating, we show that the female and both males can gain from female remating, leading to intra- and intersexual cooperation over female remating. This coevolutionary perspective yields new insights into the connection between promiscuity, fecundity, and sperm competition and the complex interplay between sexual conflict and cooperation © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Coevolutionary dynamics; Polyandry; Seminal fluid; Sexual selection; Sperm competition; Tragedy of the commons","coevolution; fecundity; fertilization (reproduction); fitness; male behavior; model test; polyandry; sexual conflict; sexual selection; sperm competition; animal; article; biological model; evolution; female; fertility; genetic selection; male; sexual behavior; spermatozoon; Animals; Evolution; Female; Fertility; Male; Models, Biological; Selection, Genetic; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Spermatozoa",,,,,,"Abrams, P.A., Modelling the adaptive dynamics of traits involved in inter- And intraspecific interactions: An assessment of three methods (2001) Ecology Letters, 4, pp. 166-175; Alonzo, S.H., Warner, R.R., Allocation to mate guarding or increased sperm production in a Mediterranean wrasse (2000) American Naturalist, 156, pp. 266-275; Arnqvist, G., Nilsson, T., The evolution of polyandry: Multiple mating and female fitness in insects (2000) Animal Behaviour, 60, pp. 145-164; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict., , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Ball, M.A., Parker, G.A., Sperm competition games: Sperm selection by females (2003) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 224 (1), pp. 27-42. , DOI 10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00118-8; Sperm competition games: The risk model can generate higher sperm allocation to virgin females (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20, pp. 767-779; Birkhead, T.R., Pizzari, T., Postcopulatory sexual selection (2002) Nature Reviews Genetics, 3, pp. 262-273; Bjork, A., Pitnick, S., Intensity of sexual selection along the anisogamy-isogamy continuum (2006) Nature, 441 (7094), pp. 742-745. , DOI 10.1038/nature04683, PII N04683; Cameron, E., Day, T., Rowe, L., Sperm competition and the evolution of ejaculate composition (2007) American Naturalist, 169, pp. E158-E172; Chapman, T., Davies, S.J., Functions and analysis of the seminal fluid proteins of male (2004) Drosophila Melanogaster Fruit Flies., 25, pp. 1477-1490. , Peptides; Clutton-Brock, T.H., The evolution of parental care (1991) Monographs in Behavior and Ecology, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Cook, P.A., Wedeil, N., Ejaculate dynamics in butterflies: A strategy for maximizing fertilization success?

In a constant environment, compensatory dynamics between species can maintain food web stability, but factors that synchronize population fluctuations within and between communities are expected to be destabilizing. We studied the dynamics of a food web in a metacommunity to determine how environmental variability and dispersal affect stability by altering compensatory dynamics and average species abundance. When dispersal rate is high, weak correlated environmental fluctuations promote food web stability by reducing the amplitude of compensatory dynamics. However, when dispersal rate is low, weak environmental fluctuations reduce food web stability by inducing intraspecific synchrony across communities. Irrespective of dispersal rate, strong environmental fluctuations disrupt compensatory dynamics and decrease stability by inducing intermittent correlated fluctuations between consumers in local food webs, which reduce both total consumer abundance and predator abundance. Strong correlated environmental fluctuations lead to (i) spatially asynchronous and highly correlated local consumer dynamics when dispersal is low and (ii) spatially synchronous but intermediate local consumer correlation when dispersal is high. By controlling intraspecific synchrony, dispersal mediates the capacity of strong environmental fluctuations to disrupt compensatory dynamics at both local and metacommunity scales. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Compensatory dynamics; Environmental variability; Food web; Metacommunity; Stability; Synchrony","abundance; community ecology; compensation; dispersal; environmental effect; food web; metapopulation; population size; stabilization; synchrony; animal; article; biological model; competitive behavior; environment; food chain; population dynamics; predation; Animals; Competitive Behavior; Environment; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior",,,,,,"Allesina, S., Pascual, M., Network structure, predator - Prey modules, and stability in large food webs (2008) Theoretical Ecology, 1 (1), pp. 55-64. , DOI 10.1007/s12080-007-0007-8; Amarasekare, P., Spatial dynamics of foodwebs (2008) Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, 39, pp. 479-500; Benton, T.G., Lapsley, C.T., Beckerman, A.P., Population synchrony and environmental variation: An experimental demonstration (2001) Ecology Letters, 4 (3), pp. 236-243. , DOI 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2001.00225.x; Bjornstad, O.N., Cycles and synchrony: Two historical ""experiments"" and one experience (2000) Journal of Animal Ecology, 69, pp. 869-873; Bjornstad, O.N., Ims, R.A., Lambin, X., Spatial population dynamics: Analyzing patterns and processes of population synchrony (1999) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 14 (11), pp. 427-432. , DOI 10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01677-8, PII S0169534799016778; Blasius, B., Huppert, A., Stone, L., Complex dynamics and phase synchronization in spatially extended ecological systems (1999) Nature, 399 (6734), pp. 354-359. , DOI 10.1038/20676; Briggs, C.J., Hoopes, M.F., Stabilizing effects in spatial parasitoid-host and predator-prey models: A review (2004) Theoretical Population Biology, 65, pp. 299-315; Buonaccorsi, J.P., Elkinton, J.S., Evans, S.R., Liebhold, A.M., Measuring and testing for spatial synchrony (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 1668-1679; Cattadori, I.M., Merler, S., Hudson, P.J., Searching for mechanisms of synchrony in spatially structured gamebird populations (2000) Journal of Animal Ecology, 69, pp. 620-638; Cheal, A.J., Delean, S., Sweatman, H., Thompson, A.A., Spatial synchrony in coral reef fish populations and the influence of climate (2007) Ecology, 88 (1), pp. 158-169. , http://www.esajournals.org/pdfserv/i0012-9658-088-01-0158.pdf, DOI 10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[158:SSICRF]2.0.CO;2; Colombo, A., Dercole, F., Rinaldi, S., Remarks on metacommunity synchronization with application to prey-predator systems (2008) American Naturalist, 171, pp. 430-442; Coulson, T., Rohani, P., Pascual, M., Skeletons, noise and population growth: The end of an old debate?

An overlooked mechanism (latitudinal variation in plant quality) might help explain Bergmann's rule. We studied three herbivores. In the field, the planthopper Prokelisia and the sea hare Aplysia, but not the long-homed grasshopper Orchelimum, were larger at high latitudes, following Bergmann's rule. In the laboratory, all three species grew larger or faster on high-latitude plants. High-latitude diets increased Prokelisia size and Aplysia growth rates by 8% and 72%, respectively, enough to explain the increase in field body size toward high latitudes. Therefore, latitudinal variation in herbivore body size could be influenced by latitudinal variation in plant quality, which may directly or indirectly also affect body size in detritivores, parasitoids, and predators. Studies of Bergmann's rule should consider the influence of biotic factors on body size in addition to abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Biogeography; Body size; Herbivore; Latitudinal variation; Plant quality; Spartina alterniflora","Bergmann Rule; body size; detritivory; food quality; grass; grasshopper; growth rate; herbivore; latitudinal gradient; mollusc; parasitoid; planthopper; precipitation (climatology); predator; slug; temperature profile; zoogeography; animal; Aplysia; body size; demography; diet; ecosystem; grasshopper; Hemiptera; physiology; review; Animals; Aplysia; Body Size; Demography; Diet; Ecosystem; Grasshoppers; Hemiptera; Anaspidea; Aplysia; Archaeorrhyncha; Orchelimum; Prokelisia; Spartina alterniflora",,,,,,"Anderson, W.W., Genetic divergence in body size among experimental populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura kept at different temperatures (1973) Evolution, 27, pp. 278-284; Angilletta, M., Dunham, A., The temperature-size rule in ectotherms: Simple evolutionary explanations may not be general (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 332-342; Angilletta, M.J.J., Niewiarowski, P.H., Dunham, A.E., Leache, A.D., Porter, W.P., Bergmann's clines in ectotherms: Illustrating a life-history perspective with sceloporine lizards (2004) American Naturalist, 164, pp. E168-E183; Arnett, A.E., Gotelli, N.J., Bergmann's rule in larval ant lions: Testing the starvation resistance hypothesis (2003) Ecological Entomology, 28, pp. 645-650; Ashton, K.G., Tracy, M.C., De Queiroz, A., Is Bergmann's rule valid for mammals?

However, recent studies suggest that crosses between natural populations can recover these genotypes. We determined the adaptive value and costs of, as well as the genetic variation for, physiological and morphological plasticity to soil water limitation in Avena barbata recombinant inbred lines (RILs) created by crossing mesic and xeric ecotypes. All traits were plastic, and plasticity in stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and photosynthetic rate before and at reproduction was adaptive. However, we detected a significant cost of plasticity only for stomatal conductance at reproduction, and the mean cost for all traits of A barbata RILs was at least 50% smaller than costs previously estimated using RILs. In addition, heritabilities for plasticity were <0.1 and were significant only for photosynthesis at reproduction and leaf mass per unit area. Our results suggest that costs are less likely to constrain the evolution of adaptive plasticity in A. barbata than genetic variation for plasticity. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Avena barbata; Costs of plasticity; Genotype x environment interaction; Phenotypic plasticity; Photosynthesis; Water stress","water; aridity; ecotype; fitness; genetic variation; grass; heritability; hypothesis testing; inbreeding; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; physiological response; recombination; soil moisture; stomata; water stress; adaptation; article; chemistry; ecosystem; genetics; inbreeding; photosynthesis; physiology; Poaceae; reproduction; soil; Adaptation, Physiological; Ecosystem; Inbreeding; Photosynthesis; Poaceae; Reproduction; Soil; Water; Avena barbata",,"water, 7732-18-5; Soil; Water, 7732-18-5",,,,"Abramoff, M.D., Magelhaes, P.J., Ram, S.J., Image processing with Image (2004) J.

Box 800.84, 3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","By applying engineering theory, we found that in order to achieve a certain degree of stem mechanical stability, trees with low wood dry-mass density (ρ<sub>D</sub>) need to produce thicker stems but invest less mass per unit stem length than those with high ρ<sub>D</sub>. Mechanical stability was expressed as the ability of the vertical stem to either support a plant's weight (i.e., the buckling safety factor) or resist wind forces without rupture. This contradicts the general notion that trees with low ρ<sub>D</sub> are more prone to mechanical failure. Contrary to our results for stems, we predicted that high ρ<sub>D</sub> can be more efficient than low ρ<sub>D</sub> in terms of the mass needed to produce a branch of given length and resistance to rupture under its own weight. Such branches were also predicted to be more flexible. These predictions were generally in accordance with literature data for tropical tree species. This shows that differences in scaling rules associated with vertical self-loading, resistance to external forces, and the production of stable horizontal branches have important implications for the way in which different crown traits determine the balance between economy of crown design and mechanical stability. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Allometry; Biomechanics; Crown structure; Trait correlations; Tropical forest","allometry; biomechanics; bulk density; canopy architecture; dry matter; mass; mechanical theory; stem; timber industry; tree stump; tropical forest; wood quality; article; biomechanics; histology; physiology; tree; wood; Biomechanics; Trees; Wood",,,,,,"Anten, N.P.R., Hirose, T., Biomass allocation and light partitioning among dominant and subordinate individuals in Xanthium canadense stands (1998) Annals of Botany, 82, pp. 665-673; Anten, N.P.R., Casado-Garcia, R., Nagashima, H., Effects of mechanical stress and plant density on mechanical characteristics, growth and lifetime reproduction of tobacco plants (2005) American Naturalist, 166, pp. 650-660; Anten, N.P.R., Pawlowski, M., Von Wettberg, E., Huber, H., Interactive effects of spectral shading and mechanical stress on the expression and costs of shade avoidance (2009) American Naturalist, 173, pp. 241-255; Augspurger, C.K., Seedling survival of tropical tree species: Interaction of dispersal distance, light gaps and pathogens (1984) Ecology, 65, pp. 1705-1712; Baker, C.J., Development of a theoretical model for wind throw of plants (1995) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 175, pp. 355-372; Bertram, J.E.A., Size-dependent differential scaling in branches: The mechanical design of trees revisited (1989) Trees, 3, pp. 241-253; Chave, J., Coomes, D., Jansen, S., Lewis, S.L., Swenson, N.G., Zanne, A.E., Towards a worldwide wood economics spectrum (2009) Ecology Letters, 12, pp. 351-366; Enquist, B.J., West, G.B., Charnov, E.L., Brown, G.H., Allometric scaling of production and life-history variation in vascular plants (1999) Nature, 401, pp. 907-911; Gardiner, B.A., Wind-tree interactions (1995) Wind and Trees, pp. 41-59. , in M.

Here we develop a general framework to integrate estimates of divergent selection and genetic constraints to estimate their contributions to phenotypic divergence among natural populations. We apply these methods to estimates of phenotypic selection and genetic covariance from sexually selected traits that have undergone adaptive divergence among nine natural populations of the fly Drosophila serrata. Despite ongoing sexual selection within populations, differences in its direction among them, and genetic variance for all traits in all populations, divergent sexual selection only weakly resembled the observed pattern of divergence. Accounting for the influence of genetic covariance among the traits significantly improved the alignment between observed and predicted divergence. Our results suggest that the direction in which sexual selection generates divergence may depend on the pattern of genetic constraint in individual populations, ultimately restricting how sexually selected traits may diversify. More generally, we show how evolution is likely to proceed in the direction of major axes of genetic variance, rather than the direction of selection itself, when genetic variance-covariance matrices are ill conditioned and genetic variance is low in the direction of selection © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Microevolution; Quantitative genetics; Sexual selection","divergence; evolutionary biology; fly; genetic variation; life history trait; phenotype; sexual selection; animal; article; biological model; Drosophila; evolution; female; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; male; physiology; sexual development; Animals; Drosophila; Evolution; Female; Genetic Variation; Male; Models, Biological; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics; Drosophila serrata",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.F., Brodie III, E.D., Rieseberg, L.H., Possible consequences of genes of major effect: Transient changes in the Gmatrix (2001) Genetica, 112-113, pp. 33-43; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection., , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Arnold, S.J., Pfrender, M.E., Jones, A.G., The adaptive landscape as a conceptual bridge between micro- And macroevolution (2001) Genetica, 112-113, pp. 9-32; Arnqvist, G., Edvardsson, M., Friberg, U., Nilsson, T., Sexual conflict promotes speciation in insects (2000) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97 (19), pp. 10460-10464; Atchison, J., (1986) The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data., , Chapman & Hall, London; Barraclough, T.G., Harvey, P.H., Nee, S., Sexual selection and taxonomie diversity in passerine birds (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 259, pp. 211-215; Barton, N.H., Turelli, M., Adaptive landscapes, genetic distance and the evolution of quantitative characters (1987) Genetical Research, 49, pp. 157-173; Blows, M.W., A tale of two matrices: Multivariate approaches in evolutionary biology (2007) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 20 (1), pp. 1-8. , DOI 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01164.x; Blows, M.W., Allan, R.A., Levels of mate recognition within and between two Drosophila species and their hybrids (1998) American Naturalist, 152, pp. 826-837; Blows, M.W., Higgie, M., Genetic constraints on the evolution of mate recognition under natural selection (2003) American Naturalist, 161 (2), pp. 240-253. , DOI 10.1086/345783; Blows, M., Walsh, B., Spherical cows grazing in flatland: Constraints to selection and adaptation (2007) Adaptation and Fitness in Animal Populations: Evolutionary and Breeding Perspectives on Genetic Resource Management., pp. 83-101J. , van der Werf, H.-U.

Through structural equation modeling, we tested whether plant strategies related to nutrient and water/oxygen supply are reflected in a coordination of traits in natural communities. Structural equation models, based on accepted ecological concepts, were tested with measured plant traits of 105 different species across 50 sites in mesic to wet plant communities in the Netherlands. For each site, nutrient and water supply were measured and modeled. Hypothesized multivariate strategy models only partly reflected current theoretical schemes. Alternative models were consistent, showing that lack of consistency of the original models was because of (i) strong correlations among traits that supposedly belong to different strategy components; (ii) poor understanding of mechanisms determining the covariation of plant maximum height, leaf size, and stem density; and (iii) lack of integrative and long-term measures of nutrient supply needed to predict coordinated plant trait responses. Our main conclusion is that a combination of trade-offs (partly) across different plant organs and diverging effects of resource supply ultimately determines the coordination of plant traits needed to ""make a living."" © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Leaf economics;

However, most empirical studies evaluate the influence of either local environmental variables or regional enrichment but not both simultaneously. Here we demonstrate the importance of combining these processes to understand continental-scale richness patterns in breeding birds. We show that neither regional enrichment nor the local environment in isolation is sufficient to characterize observed patterns of species richness. Combining both sets of variables into a single model results in improved model fit and the removal of residual spatial autocorrelation. At short timescales, local processes are most important for determining local richness, but as the timescale of analysis increases, regional enrichment becomes increasingly important. These results emphasize the need for increased integration of multiple scales of processes into models of species richness. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Biodiversity; Enrichment; Local environment; Macroecology; Regional richness; Species richness","biodiversity; bird; breeding population; empirical analysis; environmental effect; macroecology; regional climate; spatial distribution; species richness; animal; article; biodiversity; biological model; bird; environment; physiology; reproduction; time; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Environment; Models, Biological; Reproduction; Time Factors; Aves",,,,,,"Algar, A.C., Kerr, J.T., Currie, D.J., A test of metabolic theory as the mechanism underlying broad-scale species-richness gradients (2007) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 16, pp. 170-178; Allen, A.P., Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1545-1548; Angermeier, P.L., Winston, M.R., Local vs. regional influences on local diversity in stream fish communities of Virginia (1998) Ecology, 79, pp. 911-927; Belmaker, J., Species richness of resident and transient coraldwelling fish responds differentially to regional diversity (2009) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 18, pp. 426-436; Boulinier, T., Nichols, J.D., Sauer, J.R., Hines, J.E., Pollock, K.H., Estimating species richness: The importance of heterogeneity in species detectability (1998) Ecology, 79 (3), pp. 1018-1028; Brown, J.H., Two decades of homage to Santa-Rosalia: Toward a general theory of diversity (1981) American Zoologist, 21, pp. 877-888; Brown, J.H., Whitham, T.G., Ernest, S.K.M., Gehring, C.A., Complex species interactions and the dynamics of ecological systems: Long-term experiments (2001) Science, 293, pp. 643-650; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference: A Practical Information-theoretic Approach, , Springer, New York; Chong, D.L.S., Mougin, E., Gastellu-Etchegorry, J.P., Relating the global vegetation index to net primary productivity and actual evapotranspiration over Africa (1993) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 14, pp. 1517-1546; Cornell, H.V., Karlson, R.H., Species richness of reefbuilding corals determined by local and regional processes (1996) Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, pp. 233-241; Cornell, H.V., Lawton, J.H., Species interactions, local and regional processes, and limits to the richness of ecological communities: A theoretical perspective (1992) Journal of Animal Ecology, 61, pp. 1-12; Currie, D.J., Mittelbach, G.G., Cornell, H.V., Field, R., Guegan, J.F., Hawkins, B.A., Kaufman, D.M., Predictions and tests of climate-based hypotheses of broad-scale variation in taxonomie richness (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 1121-1134; Diniz-Filho, J.A., Bini, L.M., Hawkins, B.A., Spatial autocorrelation and red herrings in geographical ecology (2003) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 12, pp. 53-64; Evans, K.L., Newson, S.E., Storch, D., Greenwood, J.J.D., Gaston, K.J., Spatial scale, abundance and the species-energy relationship in British birds (2008) Journal of Animal Ecology, 77, pp. 395-405; Freestone, A.L., Harrison, S., Regional enrichment of local assemblages is robust to variation in local productivity, abiotic gradients, and heterogeneity (2006) Ecology Letters, 9, pp. 95-102; Gough, L., Osenberg, C.W., Gross, K.L., Collins, S.L., Fertilization effects on species density and primary productivity in herbaceous plant communities (2000) Oikos, 89 (3), pp. 428-439; Graham, M.H., Confronting multicollinearity in ecological multiple regression (2003) Ecology, 84, pp. 2809-2815; Griffiths, D., On investigating local-regional species richness relationships (1999) Journal of Animal Ecology, 68 (5), pp. 1051-1055. , DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00348.x; Grinnell, J., The role of the ""accidental.""

Despite this, recent model-fitting studies have found that negative interactions predominate. This suggests that more complex models may be necessary to uncover facilitation. Here we fitted models including seasonality, interannual variation, and time lags to survey data to test for patterns in positive and negative interactions among plants in a Michigan dry sand prairie. We hypothesized that interactions would be generally facilitative in this dry environment. Results indicate that most immediate (direct) interactions among dominant species are actually competitive, although interactions were more facilitative over the drier summer season. Interestingly, lagged density dependence was strong for all species in both seasons; it was positive for conspecific interactions and both positive and negative for heterospecific interactions. Observed lagged density dependence is likely due to effects from litter and/or past storage in rhizomes. Conspecific immediate and lagged interactions tended to be stronger than heterospecific interactions, suggesting that population dynamics in this community are driven mostly by conspecifics. Overall, the presence of strong lagged density dependence in this system suggests that it may be more widespread in plants than previously thought © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Community dynamics; Competition; Delayed density dependence; Facilitation; Grassland; Time lags","annual variation; arid region; community dynamics; conspecific; density dependence; ecological modeling; facilitation; grassland; seasonality; animal; article; biological model; ecosystem; Poaceae; population dynamics; season; time; Animals; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Poaceae; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Time Factors; Michigan; United States",,,,,,"Adler, P.B., Hillerislambers, J., The influence of climate and species composition on the population dynamics often prairie forbs (2008) Ecology, 89, pp. 3049-3060; Adler, P.B., Hillerislambers, J., Kyriakidis, P.C., Guan, Q., Levine, J.M., Climate variability has a stabilizing effect on the coexistence of prairie grasses (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 103, pp. 12793-12798; Albert, D.A., (1995) Regional Landscape Ecosystems of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin: A Working Map and Classification., , http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/habitat/rlandscp/index.htm, Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center Home Page General Technical Report NC-178, Version 03JUN98.

This is predicted to manifest at the organismal level in the evolution of energy allocation strategies of investing in somatic maintenance and robust stress responses in less hazardous envirnments in exchange for energy spent on growth and reproduction. Here we report experiments from long-studied populations of western terrestrial garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) that reside in low and high extrinsic mortality environments, with evolved long and short life spans, respectively. Laboratory common-environment colonies of these two ecotypes were tested for a suite of physiological traits after control and stressed gestations. In offspring derived from control and corticosteronetreated dams, we measured resting metabolism; mitochondrial oxygen consumption, ATP and free radical production rates; and erythrocyte DNA damage and repair ability. We evaluated whether these aging biomarkers mirrored the evolution of life span and whether they were sensitive to stress. Neonates from the long-lived ecotype (1) were smaller, (2) consumed equal amounts of oxygen when corrected for body mass, (3) had DNA that damaged more readily but repaired more efficiently, and (4) had more efficient mitochondria and more efficient cellular antioxidant defenses than short-lived snakes. Many ecotype differences were enhanced in offspring derived from stress-treated dams, which supports the conclusion that nongenetic maternal effects may further impact the cellular stress defenses of offspring. Our findings reveal that physiological evolution underpins reptilian life histories and sheds light on the connectedness between stress response and aging pathways in wild-dwelling organisms. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Dna damage; Free radical; Oxidative stress; Reptile, senescence; Stress response","corticosterone; free radical; aging; DNA; ecotype; energy budget; evolutionary theory; free radical; life history; longevity; mitochondrion; neonate; oxygen consumption; physiological response; pregnancy; resource allocation; senescence; snake; aging; animal; article; classification; DNA damage; DNA repair; energy metabolism; evolution; genetics; metabolism; mitochondrion; newborn; oxidative stress; physiology; snake; Aging; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Corticosterone; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Energy Metabolism; Evolution; Free Radicals; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Snakes; Reptilia; Serpentes; Thamnophis; Thamnophis elegans",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; Corticosterone, 50-22-6; Free Radicals",,,,"Abrams, P., Does increased mortality favor the evolution of more rapid senescence?

The honeydew of sap-feeding hemipterans has been suggested to appease aggressive ants, which then begin tending activities. Here, we manipulated the cuticular chemical profiles of freeze-dried insect prey to show that chemical background matching with the host plant protects Guayaquila xiphias treehoppers against predaceous Camponotus crassus ants, regardless of honeydew supply. Ant predation is increased when treehoppers are transferred to a nonhost plant with which they have low chemical similarity. Palatable moth larvae manipulated to match the chemical background of Guayaquila's host plant attracted lower numbers of predatory ants than unchanged controls. Although aggressive tending ants can protect honeydew-producing hemipterans from natural enemies, they may prey on the trophobionts under shortage of alternative food resources. Thus chemical camouflage in G. xiphias allows the trophobiont to attract predaceous bodyguards at reduced risk of falling prey itself. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Ant-treehopper interaction; Cerrado savanna; Chemical camouflage; Cuticular profile, multitrophic interaction; Mutualism","ant; antipredator defense; chemical composition; chemical defense; concealment behavior; cuticle; honeydew; host plant; mimicry; moth; mutualism; natural enemy; plant-insect interaction; planthopper; predator-prey interaction; savanna; animal; ant; chemistry; Hemiptera; nymph; physiology; plant; predation; review; secretions; Animals; Ants; Bodily Secretions; Hemiptera; Nymph; Plants; Predatory Behavior; Camponotus crassus; Cucumis melo var. inodorus; Formicidae; Guayaquila; Guayaquila xiphias; Hemiptera; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Membracidae",,,,,,"Akino, T., Nakamura, K.-I., Wakamura, S., Diet induced chemical phyomimesis by twig-like caterpillars of Biston robustum Butler (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) (2004) Chemoecology, 14, pp. 165-174; Buckley, R.C., Interactions involving plants, Homoptera, and ants (1987) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 18, pp. 111-138; Carroll, C.R., Janzen, D.H., Ecology of foraging by ants (1973) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 4, pp. 231-257; Choe, D.-H., Rust, M.K., Homopteran chemical signatures reduce aggression of tending ants (2006) Chemoecology, 16, pp. 175-178; Davidson, D.W., Cook, S.C., Snelling, R.R., Chua, T.H., Explaining the abundance of ants in lowland tropical rainforest canopies (2003) Science, 300, pp. 969-972; Del-Claro, K., Oliveira, P.S., Honeydew flicking by treehoppers provides cues to potential tending ants (1996) Animal Behaviour, 51, pp. 1071-1075; Ant-Homoptera interactions in Neotropical savanna: The honeydew-producing treehopper Guayaquila xiphias (Membracidae) and its associated ant fauna on Didymopanax vinosum (Aralicaeae) (1999) Biotropica, 31, pp. 135-144; Conditional outcomes in a Neotropical treehopperant association: Temporal and species-specific variation in ant protection and homopteran fecundity (2000) Oecologia (Berlin), 124, p. 156165; Dettner, K., Liepert, C., Chemical mimicry and camouflage (1994) Annual Review of Entomology, 39, pp. 129-154; Espelie, K.E., Bernays, E.A., Brown, J.J., Plant and insect cuticular lipids serve as behavioral cues for insects (1991) Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, 17, pp. 223-233; Hölldobler, B., Wilson, E.O., (1990) The Ants, , Belknap, Cambridge, MA; Howard, R.W., Cuticular hydrocarbons of adult Pteromalus cerealellae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and two larval hosts, Angoumois grain moth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and cowpea weevil (Coleptera: Bruchidae) (2001) Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 94, pp. 151-158; Howard, R.W., McDaniel, C.A., Blomquist, G.J., Chemical mimicry as an integrating mechanism: Cuticular hydrocarbons of a termitophile and its host (1980) Science, 210, pp. 431-433; Krebs, C.J., (1999) Ecological Methodology, , Addison-Wesley Educational, Menlo Park, CA; Menéndez, R., Marrero, D., Más, R., Fernández, I., González, L., González, R.M., In vitro and in vivo study of octacosanol metabolism (2005) Archives of Medical Research, 36, pp. 113-119; Offenberg, J., Balancing between mutualism and exploitation: The symbiotic interaction between Lasius ants and aphids (2001) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 49, pp. 304-310; Oliveira, P.S., Del-Claro, K., Multitrophic interactions in a Neotropical savanna: Ant-hemipteran systems associated insect herbivores and a host plant (2005) Biotic Interactions in the Tropics: Their Role in the Maintenance of Species Diversity, pp. 414-438. , D.

Intuitively, reciprocity should evolve if past behavior conveys information about future behavior. But it is not straightforward to understand why this should be an outcome of evolution. Most evolutionary models assume that individuals' past behavior informs others about their stable social type (defector, cooperator, reciprocator, etc.), which makes it sensible to reciprocate. In this article, after describing the central source of difficulty in the evolutionary understanding of reciprocity, I put forward an alternative explanation based on a work by O. Leimar. It consists of taking into account the fact that the payoffs to individuals in social interactions can change through time. This offers a solution because individuals' past behavior then signals their payoffs, which also makes it sensible to reciprocate. Even though the overwhelming majority of evolutionary models implicitly endorse the social types mechanism, I argue that the social incentives mechanism may underlie reciprocity in humans © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Cooperation; Human behavior; Payoffs variability; Signaling","conspecific; cooperative behavior; evolutionary biology; historical perspective; human behavior; model test; reciprocity; signaling; social behavior; theoretical study; article; evolution; human; social behavior; theoretical model; Evolution; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Social Behavior",,,,,,"André, J.B., Day, T., Perfect reciprocity is the only evolutionary stable strategy in the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma (2007) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 247, pp. 11-22; Aumann, R.J., Maschler, M.B., (1995) Repeated Games with Incomplete Information., , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Bendor, J., Swistak, P., Types of evolutionary stability and the problem of cooperation (1995) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 92, pp. 3596-3600; Binmore, K., Samuelson, L., Evolutionary stability in repeated games played by finite automata (1992) Journal of Economic Theory, 57, pp. 278-305; Boerlijst, M.C., Nowak, M.A., Sigmund, K., The logic of contrition (1997) Journal of Theoretical Biology, 185, pp. 281-293; Boyd, R., The evolution of reciprocity when conditions vary (1992) Coalitions and Alliances in Humans and Other Animals, pp. 473-489. , A.

According to Hamilton's rule, whether a mutant gene will spread in the gene pool depends on the effects of its carrier on the fitness of all individuals in the population, each weighted by its relatedness to the carrier. However, social behaviors may affect not only recipients living in the generation of the actor but also individuals living in subsequent generations. In this note, I evaluate space-time relatedness coefficients for localized dispersal. These relatedness coefficients weight the selection pressures on long-lasting behaviors, which stem from a multigenerational gap between phenotypic expression by actors and the resulting environmental feedback on the fitness of recipients. Explicit values of space-time relatedness coefficients reveal that they can be surprisingly large for typical dispersal rates, even for hundreds of generations in the future. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Extended phenotype; Hamilton's rule; Niche construction; Relatedness","behavioral ecology; dispersal; fitness; kin selection; mutation; natural selection; niche; phenotypic plasticity; relatedness; social behavior; spatiotemporal analysis; article; biological model; evolution; genetic selection; phenotype; population density; population dynamics; time; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Time Factors",,,,,,"Barton, N.H., The evolutionary consequences of gene flow and local adaptation: Future approaches (2001) Dispersal, pp. 329-340. , J.

Theory has shown that the distances over which these interactions occur may have important consequences for population and community dynamics. In particular, if intraspecific competition occurs over longer distances than interspecific competition (heteromyopia), coexistence can be promoted. We examined how intraspecific and interspecific competition scales with neighbor distance in a target-neighbor greenhouse competition experiment. Individuals from co-occurring forbs from calcareous grasslands were grown in isolation and with single conspecific or heterospecific neighbors at distances of 5, 10, or 15 cm (Plantago lanceolata vs. Plantago media and Hieracium pilosella vs. Prunella grandiflora). Neighbor effects were strong and declined with distance. Interaction distances varied greatly within and between species, but we found no evidence for heteromyopia. Instead, neighbor identity effects were mostly explained by relative size differences between target and neighbor. We found a complex interaction between final neighbor size and identity such that neighbor identity may become important only as the neighbor becomes very large compared with the target individual. Our results suggest that species-specific size differences between neighboring individuals determine both the strength of competitive interactions and the distance over which these interactions occur. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Competition experiment; Heteromyopia; Individual-based models; Log-response ratio; Neighborhood","calcareous grassland; coexistence; community dynamics; conspecific; ecological theory; herb; individual-based model; interspecific competition; interspecific interaction; intraspecific competition; intraspecific interaction; plant community; testing method; article; Asteraceae; growth, development and aging; histology; physiology; Plantago; population dynamics; Prunella; species difference; Asteraceae; Plantago; Population Dynamics; Prunella; Species Specificity",,,,,,"Aarssen, L.W., Ecological combining ability and competitive combining ability in plants: Toward a general evolutionary theory of coexistence in systems of competition (1983) American Naturalist, 122, pp. 707-731; Amarasekare, P., Competitive coexistence in spatially structured environments: A synthesis (2003) Ecology Letters, 6, pp. 1109-1122; Anderson, K., Neuhauser, C., (2002) Patterns in Spatial Simulations: Are They Real?

Over the past decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary change, spatial-genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation and example why BLUP often gives anticonservative and biased estimates of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with BLUP methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because BLUPs are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases, predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that BLUPs are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to long-term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not supported. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","BLUP; Breeding value; Evolution; Quantitative genetics; Selection","Bayesian analysis; body condition; evolutionary biology; genetic analysis; maximum likelihood analysis; natural selection; numerical model; passerine; phenotype; reaction norm; sheep; uncertainty analysis; animal; article; Bayes theorem; breeding; computer simulation; ecology; evaluation; evolution; genetic drift; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; methodology; physiology; sheep; statistical model; uncertainty; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Breeding; Computer Simulation; Ecology; Evolution; Genetic Drift; Genetic Variation; Likelihood Functions; Linear Models; Selection, Genetic; Sheep, Domestic; Uncertainty",,,,,,"Agrawal, A.A., Conner, J.K., Johnson, M.T.J., Wallsgrove, R., Ecological genetics of an induced plant defense against herbivores: Additive genetic variance and costs of phenotypic plasticity (2002) Evolution, 56, pp. 2206-2213; Agrawal, A.A., Conner, J.K., Stinchcombe, J.R., Evolution of plant resistance and tolerance to frost damage (2004) Ecology Letters, 7, pp. 1199-1208; Blasco, A., The Bayesian controversy in animal breeding (2001) Journal of Animal Science, 79, pp. 2023-2046; Brommer, J.E., Merilä, J., Sheldon, B.C., Gustafsson, L., Natural selection and genetic variation for reproductive reaction norms in a wild bird population (2005) Evolution, 59, pp. 1362-1371; Charmantier, A., Kruuk, L.E.B., Blondel, J., Lambrechts, M.M., Testing for microevolution in body size in three blue tit populations (2004) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 17, pp. 732-743; Charmantier, A., Perrins, C., McCleery, R.H., Sheldon, B.C., Evolutionary response to selection on clutch size in a longterm study of the mute swan (2006) American Naturalist, 167, pp. 453-465; (2004) Soay Sheep: Dynamics and Selection in An Island Population, , Clutton-Brock, T.

Identifying the environmental conditions in which this pattern is reversed is key to understanding the generality of the rule. We use wild and domesticated populations of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and the natural host plants of this species to explore the consequences of resource quality for the temperature-size rule. Manduca sexta reared on a high-quality host, tobacco (Nicotiana taba- cum), followed the temperature-size rule, with larger final sizes at lower temperatures. In contrast, M. sexta reared on a low-quality host, devil's claw (Proboscidea louisianica), showed the reverse response. Wild and domesticated M. sexta exhibited qualitatively similar responses. Survival, growth and development rates, fecundity, and final size decreased with decreasing temperature in M. sexta reared on devil's claw. We propose that the reversal of the temperature-size rule results from the stressful combination of low temperatures and low dietary quality. Such reversals may impact seasonal and geographic patterns of host use in Manduca and other systems. Our results suggest that the temperature-size rule occurs for a restricted range of nonstressful environmental conditions, limiting the robustness of this widespread pattern of phenotypic plasticity. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Diet quality; Life-history trade-off; Manduca sexta; Phenotypic plasticity; Temperature-size rule; Thermal reaction norm","body size; domestic species; ectothermy; environmental stress; fecundity; herb; host plant; host quality; host use; life history trait; moth; phenotypic plasticity; reaction norm; rearing; survival; temperature effect; tobacco; trade-off; wild population; adaptation; animal; article; body size; fertility; growth, development and aging; histology; Lepidoptera; physiology; temperature; tobacco; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Size; Fertility; Manduca; Temperature; Tobacco",,,,,,"Abrahamson, W.G., Weis, A.E., (1997) Evolutionary Ecology Across Three Trophic Levels: Goldenrods, Gallmakers, and Natural Enemies, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Angilletta, M.J., (2009) Thermal Adaptation: A Theoretical And Empirical Synthesis, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Angilletta, M.J., Dunham, A.E., The temperature-size rule in ectotherms: Simple evolutionary explanations may not be general (2003) American Naturalist, 162, pp. 333-342; Angilletta, M.J., Steury, T.D., Sears, M.W., Temperature, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: Fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle (2004) Integrative and Comparative Biology, 44, pp. 498-509; Arendt, J.D., Adaptive intrinsic growth rates: An integration across taxa (1997) Quarterly Review of Biology, 72, pp. 149-177; Atkinson, D., Temperature and organism size - A biological law for ectotherms?

We tested the importance of acute corticosterone elevation in aversive learning of a novel stressor by wild male eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus). We found that inhibiting corticosterone elevation (using metyrapone, a corticosterone synthesis blocker) during an encounter with a novel attacker impaired immediate escape responses and limited learning and recall during future encounters. In the wild and in outdoor enclosures, lizards whose acute corticosterone response was blocked by an earlier metyrapone injection did not alter their escape behavior during repeated encounters with the attacker. Control-injected (unblocked) lizards, however, progressively increased flight initiation distance and decreased hiding duration during subsequent encounters. Aversive responses were also initially higher for control lizards exposed to a higher intensity first attack. Further, we demonstrate a role of corticosterone elevation in recollection, since unblocked lizards had heightened antipredator responses 24-28 h later. Exogenously restoring corticosterone levels in metyrapone-injected lizards maintained aversive behaviors and learning at control (unblocked) levels. We suggest that the corticosterone mediation of antipredator behaviors and aversive learning is a critical and general mechanism for the behavioral flexibility of vertebrate prey. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Antipredator behavior; Corticosterone; Learning; Lizard; Metyrapone; Stress response","antipredator defense; blood; environmental stress; escape behavior; flight; learning; lizard; memory; steroid; wild population; corticosterone; enzyme inhibitor; metyrapone; animal; animal behavior; article; avoidance behavior; blood; drug effect; escape behavior; female; lizard; male; metabolism; physiological stress; physiology; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Behavior, Animal; Corticosterone; Enzyme Inhibitors; Escape Reaction; Female; Lizards; Male; Metyrapone; Stress, Physiological",,"corticosterone, 50-22-6; metyrapone, 22752-91-6, 2405-72-3, 54-36-4, 908-35-0; Corticosterone, 50-22-6; Enzyme Inhibitors; Metyrapone, 54-36-4",,,,"Should prey overestimate the risk of predation?

These species, however, may be vulnerable to a breakdown in postmating isolation. Here, we investigate a model system for ecological speciation: sympatric limnetic-benthic pairs of three- spine sticklebacks. Recently, stickleback hybrid abundance in Enos Lake has increased. Given that ecological selection against hybrids was historically an important component of total reproductive isolation, we tested whether ecologically dependent postmating isolation is still functioning. We compared body shape, diet, growth, and survival in present-day Enos fish with trait data in the undisturbed Paxton Lake species pair and with historical Enos Lake data. In both Paxton and historical Enos data, we found a strong correlation between body shape and diet; however, in present-day Enos fish, this correlation was absent. Using fitness estimates based on growth rates and survival, we found no evidence of selection against intermediate morphologies. It appears that postmating isolation has broken down, allowing hybrids to persist and contributing to the collapse of the species pair. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Ecological speciation; Endangered species; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Hybridization; Postmating isolation; Threespine stickleback","abundance; benthos; body shape; cytoplasmic incompatibility; endangered species; fitness; growth rate; hybrid; hybridization; morphology; natural selection; phylogeny; reproductive isolation; survival; sympatry; teleost; carbon; animal; article; body size; diet; female; genetics; histology; hybridization; male; physiology; population dynamics; sexual behavior; Smegmamorpha; social isolation; species differentiation; Animals; Body Size; Carbon Isotopes; Diet; Female; Genetic Speciation; Hybridization, Genetic; Male; Population Dynamics; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Smegmamorpha; Social Isolation",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon Isotopes",,,,"Allen, J.R.M., Wootton, R.J., Age, growth and rate of food consumption in an upland population of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L.

Early theoretical work has shown that there are different optima in rates ofdispersal between parents and offspring. Here we examine this principle when space is explicitly modeled and dispersal is achieved through a dispersal kernel. We find a consistent pattern that selection favors longer dispersal distances under maternal control of dispersal (e.g., maternal tissue surrounding a seed) compared with scenarios where offspring themselves control dispersal (as in many animals). Intriguingly, offspring control leads to better resource utilization (higher habitat occupancy) in equilibrium scenarios than does maternal control. In contrast, in species that expand their ranges, maternal control of dispersal initially leads to faster range expansion. If there is evolutionary potential for dispersal kernels to change at the leading edge of a population, this difference vanishes quickly during an invasion because offspring-controlled dispersal evolves faster and catches up with scenarios involving maternal control. There is thus less conflict in nonequilibrium scenarios. In invasive scenarios with an evolving kernel shape, disruptive selection against intermediate distances can make the kernel not only fat-tailed but also bimodal. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Dispersal distance; Dispersal evolution; Dispersal kernel; Parent-offspring conflict; Simulation model; Spatially explicit","dispersal; evolutionary biology; natural selection; parent-offspring interaction; range expansion; resource allocation; resource use; animal; animal behavior; article; computer simulation; conflict; female; population density; population dynamics; population migration; reproduction; theoretical model; Animal Migration; Animals; Computer Simulation; Conflict (Psychology); Female; Homing Behavior; Models, Theoretical; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Reproduction",,,,,,"Alexander, R.D., The evolution of social behavior (1974) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 5, pp. 325-383; Baglione, V., Canestrari, D., Marcos, J.M., Ekman, J., Experimentally increased food resources in the natal territory promote offspring philopatry and helping in cooperatively breeding carrion crows (2006) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 273, pp. 1529-1535; Bahn, V., O'Connor, R.J., Krohn, W.B., Effect of dispersal at range edges on the structure of species ranges (2006) Oikos, 115, pp. 89-96; Bengtsson, B.O., Avoiding inbreeding at what cost?

We investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal, using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system. Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but food-deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination. Population genetic data indicated that both food- and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among-population gene flow than do rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Food deception; Pollination efficiency; Pollination strategy; Pollinia; Sexual deception; Specialized pollination","evolutionary biology; flower; gene flow; herb; pollen; pollination; reproductive strategy; sexual selection; specialization; animal; article; evolution; histology; insect; male; Orchidaceae; physiology; pollination; reproduction; Animals; Evolution; Insects; Male; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Reproduction",,,,,,"Ackerman, J.D., Mechanisms and evolution of food-deceptive pollination systems in orchids (1986) Lindleyana, 1, pp. 108-113; Ackerman, J.D., Rodriguez-Robles, J.A., Melendez, E.J., A meager nectar offering by an epiphytic orchid is better than nothing (1994) Biotropica, 26, pp. 44-49; Ackerman, J.D., Meléndez-Ackerman, E.J., Salguero-Faria, J., Variation in pollinator abundance and selection on fragrance phenotypes in an epiphytic orchid (1997) American Journal of Botany, 84, pp. 1383-1390; Ayasse, M., Schiestl, F.P., Paulus, H.F., Löfstedt, C., Hansson, B., Ibarra, F., Francke, W., Evolution of reproductive strategies in the sexually deceptive orchid Ophrys sphegodes: How does flowerspecific variation of odor signals influence reproductive success?

Box 208106, New Haven, CT 06520-8106, United States","Courtship displays frequently include complex signals that females use to pick a mate. Male Costa's hummingbirds (Calypte costae) generate two acoustic signals during courtship: a vocal song produced close to a female and a dive-sound produced during a courtship dive. The song and dive-sound sound similar, and both were assumed to be produced vocally by the syrinx. Here, we show that they are not; whereas the song is produced by the syrinx, the dive-sound is producedby high-frequency fluttering of the outermost tail feathers. The Anna's hummingbird (Calypte anna), sister to the Costa's, also sings a vocal song and produces a dive-sound with the wings and outermost tail feathers that sounds similar to a portion of the song. The interspecific match in signal form between the two species is not as strong as the intraspecific match. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that the dive-sounds may have evolved first, suggesting that the song may have evolved to mimic the dive-sound. We propose the ""sexual sensory bias"" hypothesis as an explanation for the match in form between the song and the dive-sound within each species, in which we suggest that new sexual signals can arise in response to preexisting female preferences for older sexual signals. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Calypte; Hummingbird; Sexual selection; Sexual sensory bias; Sound","bioacoustics; bird; courtship; display behavior; mimicry; phylogenetics; preference behavior; sexual selection; signal; song; tail feather; animal; article; bird; classification; feather; female; male; phylogeny; physiology; sexual behavior; tail; vocalization; Animals; Birds; Feathers; Female; Male; Phylogeny; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Tail; Vocalization, Animal",,,,,,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ; Arak, A., Enquist, M., Hidden preferences and the evolution of signals (1993) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 340, pp. 207-213; Arnqvist, G., Sensory exploitation and sexual conflict (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 361, pp. 375-386; Baltosser, W.H., Scott, P.E., Costa's hummingbird: Calypte costae (1996) The Birds of North America, (251). , ed.

We demonstrate this general phenomenon by using a model in which competition for nitrogen is mediated by soil moisture, with competitive outcomes including coexistence and multiple stable states as well as competitive exclusion. In the model, soil moisture regulates nitrogen availability through soil moisture dependence of microbial processes, leaching, and plant uptake. By affecting water availability, plants also indirectly affect nitrogen availability and may therefore alter the competitive outcome. Exotic annual species from the Mediterranean have displaced much of the native perennial grasses in California. Nitrogen and water have been shown to be potentially limiting in this system. We parameterize the model for a Californian grassland and show that soil moisturemediated competition for nitrogen can explain the annual species' dominance in drier areas, with coexistence expected in wetter regions. These results are concordant with larger biogeographic patterns of grassland invasion in the Pacific states of the United States, in which annual grasses have invaded most of the hot, dry grasslands in California but perennial grasses dominate the moister prairies of northern California, Oregon, and Washington. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Coexistence;

The usual method of testing at just one parasite dose level does not allow conclusions on the distribution of susceptibility. To better understand the epidemiology and evolution of host-parasite systems, however, knowledge about the distribution of host susceptibility, the parameters that characterize it, and how it changes in response to environmental conditions is required. We investigated transgenerational effects of different stress factors by exposing Daphnia magna to standard conditions, to low food levels, or to a high dose of the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa and then measuring the susceptibility of the offspring to different spore doses of the parasite. For the analysis we used a mathematical model that predicts the fraction of infected hosts at different parasite doses, allowing us to estimate the mean and variance of host susceptibility. We find that low food levels reduce both the mean and the variance of offspring susceptibility. Parasite exposure, on the other hand, widens the offspring's susceptibility distribution without affecting its mean. Our analysis uncovered previously unknown transgenerational effects on the distribution of susceptibilities. The finding of an alteration in the variance of susceptibility to infection has implications for host and parasite dynamics and can contribute to our understanding of the stability of hostparasite interactions. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Daphnia magna; Disease susceptibility; Frailty models; Pasteuria ramosa; Transgenerational effects","bacterium; crustacean; ecological modeling; epidemiology; food availability; host-parasite interaction; host-pathogen interaction; infectivity; numerical model; parasitic disease; quantitative analysis; spore; animal; article; Bacillales; Daphnia; disease predisposition; female; fertility; host parasite interaction; parasitology; physiological stress; physiology; theoretical model; Animals; Bacillales; Daphnia; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Fertility; Host-Parasite Interactions; Models, Theoretical; Stress, Physiological",,,,,,"Aalen, O.O., Heterogeneity in survival analysis (1988) Statistics in Medicine, 7, pp. 1121-1137; Becker, N., Marschner, I., The effect of heterogeneity on the spread of disease.

We present a new hypothesis that suggests that fluid convection and chill damage to plants could form vegetation patterns with wavelengths ≈1-2 times the plant height. Previous hypotheses for small-scale vegetation pattern formation relied on a Turing process driven by competition for water, which is thought to occur in large vegetation patterns. Predictions of the new hypothesis were consistent with properties of natural grass patterns in North Carolina, contradicting the Turing hypothesis. These results indicate that similarities in pattern morphology should not be interpreted as implying similarities in the pattern-forming processes, that small-wavelength vegetation patterns may arise from mechanisms that are distinct from those generating long-wavelength vegetation patterns, and that fluid instabilities should be recognized as a cause of ecological patterns. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Chill damage; Ecological patterns; Soil moisture; Thermal convection","ecological approach; ecological modeling; fluid flow; grass; hypothesis testing; injury; morphology; numerical model; soil moisture; spatial analysis; vegetation structure; water availability; wavelength; North Carolina; United States; article; growth, development and aging; Poaceae; temperature; theoretical model; thermodynamics; United States; Convection; Models, Theoretical; North Carolina; Poaceae; Temperature",,,,,,"Atwell, B., Kriedemann, P., Turner, C., (1999) Plants in Action, 1. , McMillan Education Australia, South Yarra, Victoria; Ball, P., (2001) The Self-made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brede, A., (1999) Turfgrass Cultivars of Zoysia Sinica, , US Patent 5977450.

Both of these characteristics have a spatial component. Habitat-restricted dispersal frequently leads to spatial genetic structure among individuals, and flooding often imposes spatially specific mortality. Here I report that following a severe flood, an interaction between these factors resulted in an immediate reduction of genetic diversity and genetic divergence of the postflood population. Survival was spatially biased toward more closely related individuals, and this was propagated throughout the postflood population by changes in reproduction. Not only did the number of closely related breeding pairs increase, but so did the production of offspring by individuals. These changes precipitated strong genetic effects, including a reduction in observed heterozygosity, an increase in relatedness, a doubling of inbreeding levels, and significant genetic divergence from previous years. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Bottleneck;

In cooperatively breeding American crows, we compared predictions of four female benefits hypotheses-the genetic diversity, good genes, genetic compatibility, and direct benefits hypotheses- to our predictions if EPP was primarily male driven. We found that genetically diverse broods were not more successful, extrapair young were not in better condition and did not have a higher survival probability, and, contrary to prediction, offspring sired by within- group extrapair males were more inbred than within-pair offspring. There was evidence of direct benefits, however: provisioning rate and number of surviving offspring were higher in groups containing within-group extrapair sires. Females therefore derived no apparent benefits from extragroup extrapair males but both direct benefits and genetic costs from within-group extrapair males. We suggest that males and females both influence the distribution of EPP in this system. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","American crows; Direct benefits; Extrapair paternity; Genetic compatibility; Genetic diversity; Good genes","cooperative breeding; extra-pair copulation; female; food provisioning; genetic variation; good genes hypothesis; passerine; paternity; reproductive cost; reproductive strategy; survival; animal; article; crow; female; genetics; male; physiology; sexual behavior; Animals; Crows; Female; Male; Sexual Behavior, Animal",,,,,,"Akcay, E., Roughgarden, J., Extra-pair paternity in birds: Review of the genetic benefits (2007) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9, pp. 855-868; Alexander, R.D., The evolution of social behavior (1974) Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 5, pp. 325-383; Amos, W., Wilmer, J.W., Fullard, K., Burg, T.M., Croxall, J.P., Bloch, D., Coulson, T., The influence of parental relatedness on reproductive success (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 268, pp. 2021-2027; Arnqvist, G., Kirkpatrick, M., The evolution of infidelity in socially monogamous passerines: The strength of direct and indirect selection on extrapair copulation behavior in females (2005) American Naturalist, 165 (SUPPL.), pp. S26-S37; (2007) The Evolution of Infidelity in Socially Monogamous Passerines: A Response to Griffith.

Iguanid lizards and boine snakes are ancient Gondwanan lineages whose distribution has been demonstrated to have been influenced by continental drift. Their enigmatic presence on the islands of the Pacific, however, has drawn fantastical conclusions of more than 8,000-km rafting from the Americas. We reexamine the hypothesis of dispersal in light of new molecular data and divergence time estimates. Our results suggest an early Paleogene (50-60 million years) divergence of these groups and the plausibility of an Asiatic or Australian (over land) source. Because the subfossil record indicates that iguanas (but not snakes) were a primary food source of island inhabitants, the absence of these species from islands with a longer history of human presence is unsurprising. Together these findings are taken as evidence of the influence humans have had on these taxa and are put forth as an example of anthropogenic obfuscation of biogeographic history. We suggest that this history is one of terrestrial connections permitting the colonization of the islands of the Pacific. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.","Biogeography; Oceanic dispersal; Pacific ocean; Vicariance","colonization; continental drift; dispersal; divergence; fossil record; Gondwana; hypothesis testing; island biogeography; lizard; molecular analysis; Paleogene; population distribution; snake; subfossil; vicariance; zoogeography; Asia; Australia; South America; Tuamotu Archipelago; animal; article; classification; geography; lizard; Pacific islands; phylogeny; population dynamics; snake; Animals; Geography; Lizards; Pacific Islands; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics; Snakes",,,,,,"Ash, J., Vegetation ecology of Fiji: Past, present, and future perspectives (1992) Pacific Science, 46, pp. 111-127; Austin, C.C., Molecular phylogeny and historical biogeography of Pacific Island boas (Candoia) (2000) Copeia, 2000, pp. 341-352; Austin, J.J., Arnold, E.N., Jones, C.G., Reconstructing an island radiation using ancient and recent DNA: The extinct and living day geckos (Phelsuma) of the Mascarene Islands (2004) Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 31, pp. 109-122; Benton, M.J., Donoghue, M.J., Asher, R.J., Calibrating and constraining molecular clocks (2009) The Timetree of Life, pp. 35-86. , S.
